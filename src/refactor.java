public class Refactoring {

	public static void refactor() {
		Shaking my head, wondering what sort of idiot wrote this.
		(What do you mean, it was me?)	
		The refactoring period is one of great joy
		A bit of downtime between new projects
		The chance to re-right all wrongs
		Apply everything we've learned
		In the hot language du jour
		To bolster the foundation
		To strip off layers of paint
		That somehow became load-bearing.
		I certainly feel much better with it completed.
		There's no chance we're ever going to need to do this again.

		writeSomeCode();
		refactor();
		//ahh, it's perfect now.
		//...
		//wait, what?
		refactor();
		//well, that's better
		//...
		//OMG
		while (1) { refactor(); }
