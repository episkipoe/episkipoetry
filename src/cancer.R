A portrait of an onco gene:
slices of time caught in vitro
while the patient wastes away in vivo
I watch a vascular structure grow in silico
and at the end of the day commiserate in vino.

Technology reveals a tumor's proclivities             '
The exact ways in which it plans to kill me.
But its modus operandi includes a bag of tricks,
Metastasis and mutation, which makes time an enemy

Science is occasionally about statistical rigor.
And is dominated by images and intuition.
So I write some code that is tactile.
I need my fingers in the DNA.

To separate cell signal from the noise.
The chimeric wheat from the chaff.
Find the mechanism of action
And viable drug targets
And kill it first.
