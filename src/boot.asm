	I raise the mug and perform a threat assessment on its content.
	Something left over from last night.
	Sniff test. Sip. A pause, another taste. Cough. Sip. Ponder. 
	What did I just put in my mouth?
	I hope it was coffee.
	At least mostly coffee.
	It's too early for not drinking coffee.
	Yesterday I got lucky.
	Today it's only water.
	I get up to make a pot.	
	Accidentally pour whole beans into the filter.
	Making coffee in the morning can be troublesome 
	When you have to do it before drinking your first cup.

	call work

	The day is long, the end is near.
	two cents in my pocket.
	I can't buy a snack with that.
	Someone poured the cold coffee down the drain 
	And hid the coffee pot.
	Must have caffeine.
	Scraping fragments of beans from the blades of the grinder.
	Because I need a little more to survive the day.
	Weary and wired.  Scattered and shaking
	A few more lines of coffee, of code
	And I'll call it complete.
	I could with another cup get some more work done.
	But it's just energy borrowed from the future. 
	And I've such an insurmountable debt already.
