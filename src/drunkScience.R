Drunk science
Is my favorite kind of science.
Merely a wee bit, enough to get the mind wandering
Loosen up inhibitions and reduce reliance on conventional thinking
Everyone feels that they can fix the world when they've been drinking.'

Reading about the role of methylation in bee brains
while engaging in my own ethanol-based epigenetic modification.
Leaves me wondering:  if I ate enough royal jelly, would I become a queen, too?

Looking at the hypothesis through beer goggles.
That which initially seemed inconceivable
3 sheets of white paper to the wind 
Now is a forgone conclusion.

A drink later and I enter the belligerent stage,
Criticizing the author's custom perl scripts.'

Too wobbly to keep my balance on the table
But I can still differentiate anything differentiable

I may be slurring my speech 
But I can still scramble up a sigmoidal activation function

Security tells me to get down off the light pole,  
There are plenty of trees to climb.
Hanging out with my best bud.
A minor altercation but now all is forgiven.
And after he passed out we wrote a draft for PNAS on his face in permanent marker.
Rum and coke is my coauthor.

The next morning groggy, but eager to gaze upon my magnum opus.
Instead I find sentences that that reflect an embarrassing level of:
inanity:  "to live well is to love.  but to love is to lose"
insanity:  "Steins and truth.  Dimples and passports."
incompetence:  "life moves for me slow and hazy"
