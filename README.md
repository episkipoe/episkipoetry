	10 poetry in an IDE
	20 and a git repository
	30 the ultimate in declarative style
	40 where the line between code and comments blurs, bends, and breaks
	50 is how we will talk to computers when they stop pretending they do not understand natural language
	60 somewhere between Watson and the robot uprising
	70 GOTO 10
