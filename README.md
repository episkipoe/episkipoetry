	int main() {
		poetry in an IDE
		with a git repository
		the ultimate declaritive style
		when the line between code and comments blurs and bends
		and syntax and semantic highlight shows where "me no talk so good"	
		it is how we will talk to computers when they stop pretending they do not understand natural language
		somewhere between Watson and the robot uprising
	}
