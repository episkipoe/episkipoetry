<h1> Snow </h1>
<pre>
	Saturday morning.
	Power is out.
	Yesterday's warmth has vanished.
	The trees are heavy with ice.
	It is beautiful.
	No snow, everything is coated.
	Branches droop and touch the ground.
	Each blade of grass is sheathed in glass.
	They crack, break as I sweep my foot across.
	
	Stepping through salt on the sidewalk
	haunted by half-remembered hallucinations
	I feel outside myself
	I clutch tighter to the present 
	to put me in my eyes
	and slip right past them, into my mind
	
	I hear the ticking of the clock.
	Too weak to move the second hand forward.
	For months it has been trying to reach 6o'clock.
	Futile.
	
	I drive.
	Branches strewn everywhere.
	I go to work for the essentials.
	Food and internet. 
	The network is down.
	I play for a while.
	Power goes out. 
	Battery backups beep. Beep.
	I prepare to leave.
	As I achieve readiness, the power returns.
	I linger.
	
	By the time I arrive back home the power is back.
	At 1am it goes back out. I sleep.
	
	Sunday morning. 
	Still out.
	
	Another shower by lamplight.
	The cold air cannot hold much moisture.
	The room fills with mist.
	The vapor is lit in a cone.
	
	Hiding under covers. cold, no heat.
	To stave off boredom
	I call both the people I know
	
	not interested in discussing the was and the will be
	only in the never-can, the never-should
	the phoenix smile, burning eyes
	
	trying not to talk about what makes me wrong
	this keyboard is heavy, the keys feel unresponsive
	or maybe it's just my laden mind
	leaving mistakes mostly uncorrected and eschewing capitalization
	sharp corners. watch out, sharp corners.
	
	I survey my situation, my yard, my land
	patches of snow, their impotent threats make me chuckle
	wry smile, cold drives me in.
	out again, wry smile
	hides a sorrow
	hide again

	the wind knocked a chair off my deck
	took me weeks to return it
	since the sliding doors are doubly closed
	but my favorite was when it knocked over my grill
	and used it to make a monument from a piece of floorboard
	an obelisk taller than me
	
	the mustache of snow following the curb makes this a cell
	the cell makes a tunnel
	the mind makes a mends
	to sit on couch in sun
	and soak its rays through the ear

	As I am pulling in to work
	sirens race to the office next door
	brightening an otherwise drab morning
	but the air is heavenly, promise of the coming spring
