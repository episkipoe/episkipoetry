	Sunday
	I come upstairs, the light burns out as I turn it on
	I replace the bulb, reach for the pad and pills
	from the hairdrying chair
	early evening, been a long day
	but oh so vacuous
	ill-conceived stumbling and stammering
	computational ramblings
	things to do, always such a small set. 
	I don't feel quite Turing-complete
	so easy to enumerate:
	eat, eat, play, drink. ooh, lovely. 
	another day done and gone
	the weary vector pointing up
	gains a little more magnitude
	the memory of the scent of joy follows
	mind wanders, lingers on a splash of color: red
	drowns in the swirling, clear fluid. eddies of ethanol
	push away the promises made
	push until the pain fades
	I hate being me too vividly
	I wake into my own head with a measure of regret
	so I take another drink and escape into the wilderness
	to enjoy the last of the nice days.
	my neighbors seems to be playing an approximation of cricket
	but I think that's a tennis racket.
	I walk by without a word.
	a girl says to her little yappy dog:
	"when you look like a rat you're not scaring anybody"
	elicits a little grin
	smell of cooking, sounds of conversation
	and I am so far from it
	in my head miles away in rumination
	attention captured by the plastic wheels of
	a Barbie jeep passing me by with a bike in pursuit
	sitting in the park, watching the sun set. 
	the chill is emboldened by the dark
	I head home

	I think I am the king of not being the king of things.
	Sovereign in a empire beset by tears.
	I am the prince of oblivion. 
	A royal refugee.
	
	Sometimes losing the mind feels literal.
	It wanders out the head like a wisp of smoke. 
	Pinch it back in place.
	Reminds me of the sixth grade. Nurses office.
	Lying on the yellow bed.  The sensation of rising
	Something I try to recapture, but the older I get
	the more real this seems to become
	the illusion that I live.
	
	And again the fear, the hole inside.
	That the hours try to fill, but the hours just pretend.
	I've filled it before with hate and lust.
	A date with Charon, moon burnt picnic on the shore of Styx.
	But now it is just a hole. 
	
	I keep thinking I want to go home.
	But the thought is really that I want a home to go to.
	I am a twelve year old that touches a tree and calls base. 
	I can't relax without thinking about the time I am wasting.
	My heart is on a marathon and I can't keep pace.
	I can't keep this up much longer.
	
	You have no idea.  I say to myself.
	
	But still I am a person. 
	That laughs when no one is looking.
	Even when I feel that I should cry.

	I turn and see that another creepy cave cricket has crawled into bed with me
	these things are getting ridiculous
	I blow on him, he hops. away.
	again. he hops on to my pillow.
	I poke him with a pen and he retreats to the far edge
	the freaky little thing fascinates me
	
	the shadow of one ascends my starry tapestry
	(this is where my friend Polonius hangs out)
	he reaches the top and crawls along the edge
	I expect him to jump, just for fun
	on the other side he climbs back down his celestial staircase

	how many more full moons will I see?
	spending nights in quiet tranquility
	gazing on the faroff light so pale
	till the flirty orb discards her final veil
	another page falls careless to the floor
	another day tossed careless to the night
	the darkness strains against artificial light
	for a moment the moon through the window holds me rapt
	til earthly things steal my mind and white walls I see
	it's almost ten o' clock.  how did this happen?
	a heaven of cardboard and spackle we build
	a fifty cent bulb spares us from life's great mystery.
	I turn off the light to try to sleep and 
	instead I'm watching shadows on my wall.
	its face modestly covered by trees,
	the moon blows kisses farewell.
	hour of eleven draws near
	lights are on and I'm writing.

	holy fuck.  it's midnight!  how does that happen?
	it sneaks in, the shadowy wretch,
	as I tend to my notes.  a page, a page,
	a prick of weariness and a glance at the clock
	holy fuck.  it's midnight!  Am I still awake?
	I finish cataloging the sins of the day.  
	with urgency I try to relax
	and drop the pen and drift to sleep

	it's now after one and I'm still up
	sleep comes hard in this heat
	I'm gazing at the glow in the dark stars that I applied earlier
	(purchased for $4.26 on my way back from the Simpsons movie,
	my one trip outside this weekend)
	and the calm outside disappears.
	to fury in a breath. inhale. exhale.
	I step outside to revel in the roar of wind
	the promise of cooling rain
	complete with lightning
	it's still over 90 inside
	sleep comes hard in this heat
	and now I've this noise to contend with 
	I sigh and lie back in bed
	power cuts off right before I can turn off the lights
	"ahh, fuck" I say.

	Thunder calls and I step out into the storm
	into the night, but the sky is white with electric light
	indistinct and boltless; the sky surges
	the earth looks eerie and unnatural
	the shimmering grass seems to fade and approach
	
	Waking in the middle of a dream where I was a webserver
	Harder than it should be to convince me that I'm not a daemon
	In the dark I see snippets of code, packets and ascii characters
	traffic routes around me as I sit upright befuddled.

	familiar questions running through my head
	am I alive or am I dead?
	not allowed to smile
	since I am a devil-child
