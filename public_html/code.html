	with an excited little giggle I jump up onto my chair
	ooh, it's fun to be coding again
	and what is the source of such profound joy?
	why it's that old hag hierarchical clustering
	but look at her now with a fresh coat of paint
	re-written in some C++ that is terse and eloquent
	all the gotos are gone and we have more proper demarcation of responsibility
	and a re-usable result is generated

	the philosophy behind pointers
	bit of bull shit, I know but
	an explorable example of how
	a representation of a thing is different different from the thing
	If you can grok that...
	(may all your mallocs give you memory)

	what did I say and why did I say that?
	sometimes I am weakly typed
	I know I ought not speak
	ruled by a mood
