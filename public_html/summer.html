	Lying under the sun in the fresh-cut grass
	I just ate an ice cream sandwich
	this is a good day
	bug lands on my face and I brush it away
	I open my eyes at the chirping of birds
	and see the vapor trail of a plane
	as it plots its course against the blue, blue sky
	the shadow of the sugar gum maple creeps towards me
	I lie there and let it - it's a shadow I'm not afraid of

	I'm on a mission to find a place to swim
	the river is still too high, too fast
	no County park allows swimming in lakes
	and the pool at the Babbler state park is decrepit and closed
	this park says Beach and so I head towards it
	driving on ridges, past nice houses
	and I'm the only one parked in this small lot
	I love living in my own little secret world
	I lean over my trunk and study the map
	another car pulls up; I nonchalantly stroll over to sit on my hood
	She said that it was pretty, so I said yeah
	I thought she was talking about the day; the train was passing nearby
	and in retrospect I think she was talking about my hair
	it's in the mid-90s and I'm sweating
	between the blue bug-fairies and the cotton wood castoffs
	the world glows like a TV's dream or a soap opera
