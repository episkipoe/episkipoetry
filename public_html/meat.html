<h1>Being Meat</h1>
<pre>
	motion ahead of me catches my eye as I drive
	a leaf, a leaf. a smoldering cigarette butt
	carelessly tossed. it tumbles, twirls
	rolls and comes to a rest
	I am reminded that we're bred for this
	to have our attention taken by moving things
	things that could be coming to eat us
	such are the risks associated with being meat.

	busy at work, tech support
	headaches and Dead Wood
	I'm trying to do better
	but it's so hard to do right
	when right is so narrow a path
	and wrong is such an inviting garden
	with butterflies.  and flowers.
	
	Monday 
	curled in a ball on the couch
	coughing and convulsing
	writing on a pizza box
	an autumn night so strange to hear
	the ice cream man drive by
	his lure eerie and sinister
	piercing my delirium
	as I struggle to stay sober
	(it shouldn't be this hard)
	scratches of clarity like candy in the pain
	then eyes close and head lolls
	lost in the detox dream-world
	is that a universal truth I see?
	oh, no. just my front door.
	glass and wrought metal
	flourishes and beauty are wasted on me
	
	I've been listening to Ieva's Polkka
	over and over again
	power's gone out every day this week so far
	I surmise, since I come home to flashing clocks
	and the microwave won't cook unless I set:
	the time. am/pm. month. day. year.
	oh. you need the date? seriously?
	I imagine what is going through the engineer's mind
	"but sir, we need to take into account
	the exact declension of the sun in order to serve
	proper culinary justice to this microwaved burrito"
	Well, I hope you have a contingency plan for deceit, fucker
	because it isn't really 3am Oct 10, 2010
	now cook my damn egg roll.
	
	I have bled my world so dry that it crackles. 
	A few of my fingers pooling nicely the blood.
	So I at random leave streaks of it behind.
	The smell and taste of iron.
	
	Another Monday must be losing my mind.
	A week since I wrote that line. 
	My wounds are mostly healed.
	
	A wee bit of hibernation, I suppose.
	Someday I might just fall off the map.
	I am a sorrowful grey town after a rain.
	But the peace is worth all the pain.

	and so I put down the bone saw that I used 
	to break open my ribs and let someone see my heart
	and I wrap my chest in cellophane to keep out the phages
	and to make sure that the light bends slightly
	and that it is still impossible to touch

	but time festers all wounds.  else we would never die.
	if it could cure us of age or a very tired heart.
