	The world looks best, I've decided, an hour before sunrise
	with the sun hiding below the horizon
	and giving just a hint of pink tint
	to the clouds covering the sky.
	It looks sci-fi, cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic
	driving through a fine drizzle on a warm November day

	The first puff looks like powdered sugar
	I'm imagining a frenzied donut-eating session in the car ahead of me
	The second puff looks more wispy and I realize he's smoking

	I'm admiring the small skull sticker 
	on the back of the PT Cruiser  (plate: RU Cruzn)
	a little memento mori.  stare and focus
	foot off the brake.  stare and focus
	it's pretty realistically rendered
	he turns right on Ladue

	remembering to swerve:
	away from road kill
	and towards the styrofoam

	dead raccoon, middle of road, as I drive to work
	smell of rotting and lots of cars when I get home
	another party, I guess.
	I remember seeing flashing lights last night 2am.
	people milling about. cops or an ambulance?
	
	lost grey cat
	the sign says
	lost grey cat no tail
	on the post of the stoplight
	lost grey cat no tail Reward
	on the corner of Burgundy and 141
	look for the cat but don't look for the tail

	I wake and dawdle a little
	then to the bank to cash my check
	I wish I had the power to wave people through red lights
	I get a green arrow that I don't really need
	which makes the lone oncoming car come to a stop
	I pull into the bank and park next to
	a bottle of water and a black sock
	I turn the car off and notice the rising sun shining on the clock
	reveals that it keeps ticking the time even when it's off	

	Last night I was afraid, turning a corner,
	that reality wouldn't follow me
	that I would walk off the edge 
	that is my world.

	my head comes sneaking back from behind
	or sometimes suddenly it surrounds me
	once again I see with clear eyes
	and now night is new
	and too large
	so I rock back and forth in the car
	trying to hide behind eyelids
	to push it back, push it away
	but I spy some trees lit in stark contrast
	and I can't help but find the scene beautiful
	and I relax and pull in to my driveway
