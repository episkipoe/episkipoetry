	Storming over several nights, power's been out 3 days
	morning shower by lamp, the steamy room is filled with light
	walking around my neighborhood in the evening
	a man, I can't tell whether he asks "how" or "hell" I'm doing
	cheerfully I responded and daggers he looked back at me
	I look a shambles, shady in this coat
	and with the Guinness down the gullet
	
	a storm wakes me in the night, the loudest part is the flapping of my vertical blinds
	I remember thinking "now would be a good time for this to not be happening"
	I shut the window and go back to sleep

	awakened a half hour later by lightning, thunder
	the sound of a navel battle to the south west
	man the long guns
	one strike is particularly disquieting in its proximity
	the house shakes, I can't fight it
	then the rain comes
	more rain
	3am
	the sound of the storms now comes from the north east
	I fall back asleep

	and each time it is a blend of nightmare and reality
	vague recollection of... pacing and cursing
	punching something
	I turn off the fan
