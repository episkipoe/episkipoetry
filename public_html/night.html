	what heaven it is
	to open the door and walk into the night
	with the moon illuminating the cloud cover
	the temperature outside is the same as inside
	feeling the chilly touch of each little breeze
	I hear the rushing water in the nearby crick
	the hum of the neighbor's air conditioner
	thunder in the distance
	crickets, crickets
	and you can tell it's those fat black ones
	not the wimpy little brown ones or the day's green ones
	or those creepy cave crickets
	and I hear no voices, no people
	stand on the rail and raise a hand
	pace back and forth, then sit and write
	and wait for this to last forever
	breathe deeply and attach this night
	to the rest that have come before
	high school weekends in the sweet silence of an empty world
	watching the yellow blinking of the warning sign
	a graveyard in Kentucky on the shore of a lake
	pretending to be mature when I was scared
	walking amongst the trees at Knox
	after another false fire alarm in Seymour
	sneaking a furtive smoke on the balcony
	of a motel in the badlands
	sitting under the eave of the house (soffit, fascia)
	feeling raindrops on my naked feet
	I feel if I can just fail to fall asleep
	then this scene will never end
	but the headlights of a passing car break the spell
	and remind me of morning's surcharge for nightly splurges

	the Internet fades in and out while I watch the IT crowd
	and so I head outside - beery wanderings in a quiet midnight
	I want to see the Milky Way
	and I settle for lightning skies and lightning bugs
	the smell of a city's summer rain
	in sweat pants and a sleeveless shirt
	and nobody sees me as I make my way through the neighborhood
	the freedom gives me an intense and palpable joy
