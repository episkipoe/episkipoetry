<h1> <a name = "0x0" /> 0x0 Morning </h1>
<pre>
	I boot
	hygiene in BIOS
	jmp shower
	goto work

	Morning.
	The smell of damp soil
	driving in the dark with windows down
	we are all only eyes now. 
	The nervous red blinking of a biker
	the shining white shoes of a jogger

	Another grey Monday
	silent lightning in the distance
	dead hawk on the side of the road
	looks larger, less regal than in flight
	discarded carcass bloated and ruffled. 
	Unseeing eyes now point to the skies
	while uncaring commuters race by.
	The corridor which carries me to work
	lies in that balance between rustic and urban
	where neither man nor nature feel quite at ease.

	Driving behind a charcoal colored GrandAm
	Sticker on the back among the rivulets of dew
	reads "In Loving Memory"
	of someone like Tim Leviticus Horton
	wisps of smoke rising from the window
	a hand taps a cigarette
	now motioning "What the fuck!?"
	as the driver encounters some traffic
	he catches the lucky side of a light turning red
	and I lose him
	
	the grey Altima blends into the fog and mist
	a dainty black gloved hand is out the window and agitated, taps the roof
	he moves to the right to let a school bus change lanes

	Sometimes I feel not quite ready for this world
	then I look around and see
	that the world is filled with clowns and children
	those that admit it and those that deny
	afraid of their own absurdity
	nervously chuckling at mine

	The clock I drive past says 6:00
	I am tempted to stand in the street
	in my red converse and anarchy t-shirt 
	to watch all the lights to the east
	turn from blinking yellow to solid green
	but it also said 32 degrees
	and three of my fingers are numb
	I go inside.
</pre>
<h1> <a name = "0x1" /> 0x1  Ode on Coffee </h1>
<pre>
	Early morning, turn monitors on.
	I perform a threat assessment on the contents of my coffee cup.
	sniff test. sip. cough. sip. ponder. seems ok.
	when I came back from Seattle I drank the sludge I left behind
	most disgusting thing I put in my mouth in a long time
	a chunk of cookie turned to slime.
	today's contents are fresh, from yesterday

	I raise the mug and take a sip
	of the concoction left on my desk
	A pause, a taste
	oral introspection
	What did I just put in my mouth?
	I hope it was coffee
	at least mostly coffee
	it's too early for not drinking coffee
	yesterday I got lucky
	today I suspect that it was only water
	sometimes I don't finish my breakfast slim fast
	leaving it one day is okay.  four days will make you sick.
	
	Accidentally pour whole beans into the filter
	The trouble with making coffee in the morning
	is that you have to do it before drinking your first cup
	
	Ctrl-F4.  click.  c.
	xmms pipes music to my ears
	Alt-tab.  Slashdot.  scroll wheel.
	The sounds of screwin' around
	then the mood takes me (coffee activates)
	Ctrl-F1.  and it's a furious clatter of clicking keys
	Code.  Compile.  Execute
	Alt-f  down enter
	Data takes a minute to load.
	Ctrl-F3.  Checking email, send a response or two
	Ctrl-F1.  Data's loaded run some tests
	Test takes a minute to run.
	Mind wanders past the boundary of the desktop
	Ctrl-F4.  Check my other email, some more Slashdot
	Ctrl-F2.  Fire off a job on my vmware machine
	on Eldar through VNC if I'm feeling plucky
	Ctrl-F1.  Check the results.
	Lather Rinse Repeat.

	finished drinking breakfast
	it'll take a few more cups to make it through the day
	it's a time machine
	the drink of it sustains me, propels me to the future
	the smell of it always takes me back to years gone by
	college, freshman year summer in the factory, paper cups and a cigarette
	senior year experiments with espresso
	junior high, drinking it by the pot, challenging the night
	high school, a talking cat, driving my brother and his friends to a movie
	the Avengers and I'm on my third wind and slap-happy
	I shake my head and return to present-day

	The day is long, leaves the taste burnout in my mouth 
	The big picture leaves my head reeling 
	so I turn on my eyes for a while
	and stare 
	and stir 
	then sip some more

	the end is nearing
	two cents in my pocket
	I can't buy a snack with that
	and someone poured the coffee down the drain 
	and hid the coffee pot

	Must have caffeine.
	Push the blades of the grinder
	to scrape enough onto my finger
	The mush to my mouth and life fills me again. 
	Because I need the trance if I'm to survive the day
	weary and wired.  scattered and shaking
	a few more lines of coffee, of code
	and I'll call it complete 

	I could with another cup get some work done.
	But caffeine is just energy borrowed against future production. 
	And I've such an insurmountable debt already.
</pre>
<h1> <a name = "0x2" /> 0x2  Computo ergo sum </h1>
<pre>
	a fresh install of Fedora 8
	the promise of a beautiful tomorrow.  and headaches today
	eth0 has always been finicky with my NICs
	I believe that she was the one that drove me into the arms of FreeBSD
	so close to working. two (or was it three?) executables die on startup
	and it is a fairly sparse install
	ah, but X starts and stills the bleating of my heart
	I visit konsole and visudo myself
	As King I crown myself Prince
	and spend some minutes tweaking themes to make it feel like home
	
	 *ode to a pointer
	 &amp;oh, kind sir, made of hex
	 *remind me again where I left my integer array

	I am a code monkey at heart
	but I have a manager mind that creeps out occasionally.
	It scares me and I try to bat it down.
	I swallowed the urge to request a meeting
	to discuss how too much of our time is being spent in meetings

	I return
	to the whir of fans
	and command-line incantations
	a magic pipe | to open the door
	and I find myself in
	hello world electronic
	at once skittish and vainglorious
	I cavort with command line concubine
	and dance with the gaudy GUI

	It gives my blood the stirring quality.  mental gymnastics
	Half a cartwheel then crash into the mat
	then a three-fourths of a backflip
	and jumping on that springy triangle thing.
	but halfway through the air I'm on the uneven bars
	and I'm coding this and documenting that
	writing more and more specs
	Interrupted for support.
	Now where was I?

	Writing in the car while my brother drives, listening to Bad Religion
	Reading in-between.  Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
	Halfway between this world and the NeXT
	[I am a man, part machine, born of circuit stock
	my pulse is measured in megahertz
	synapse sparks keyboard hand
	gathering digital daisies
	under a silicon sun...]
</pre>	
<h1> <a name = "0x3" /> 0x3  The Zone </h1>
<pre>
	And now I finally have a block of time
	to dedicate to writing code.
	I'm entering it.
	My mind leaves the body
	drifting.  a slow, drifting.  sinking.

	the human is in the body
	but the hacker is somewhere between the fingers and the kernel 
	a place where C is a native tongue 
	and signs say "Assembly spoken here"

	The body begins to sway a little.
	I feel blind, in that I see without eyes
	code and structs come alive and talk to me.
	I make my music louder to drown the human voices.
	A dirge, a dance.  A frantic thrashing.
	typing as fast as I can 
	first thinking about the code three lines down
	now four files away

	A distraction.  I'm back in the real world staring at a wall.
	pause the music, get some coffee and return
	hold the cup like lofting a chalice
	sacrament with saccharine
	and we're off again

	A hiatus is put on medium/long term projects
	Now leashed, I pace in my kennel
	detached from the kernel
	without the hack I am nothing
	but a lost soul. wandering, distracted
	kid gloves on, gently massaging the code 
	and the release is a rolling two weeks away


</pre>	
<h1> <a name = "0x4" /> 0x4  Daylight </h1>
<pre>
	765 weekdays have passed since I've started working here.
	Today I changed my voice mail message.
	So it no longer says I'm Chad.

	Code causes contusions, cuts sharp and deep. 
	I compile some armor and execute an assault on bugs
	My shaking foot gives rise to erratic mouse movement
	I fear that I am building a house of cards again
	infrastructure must be secure, must be beautiful
	to carry with honor the scars that users inflict

	I have an electronic womb.
	Which gives rise to robo-maternal responses.
	I feel as though I've forked myself
	several separate threads competing for resources
	stepping on each other interjecting thoughts into my brain
	mutated mutex, the guards have failed me
	priority queue gone completely askew
	First In, First Thrown away if not last
	but hey, at least it's amortized access of O(1)
	I fix a critical bug forthwith 
	but this feature request goes in the ignore pile
	I'll slice you twenty minutes for a support call
	but you'll get my mind for only ten of them
	then some thought or other ends up in an infinite loop
	I need to take a break.

	something sinfully delicious in being outside in the middle of a weekday.
	workers of the world untie  yourselves from your desks.

</pre>
<h1>0x5  Debugging </h1>
<pre>
	bashing away at the devil in the details
	of column filters, numbers, indices
	overwhelmed by errors that make no sense
	my mind spiders the problem space
	too many things to keep track of.
	Understanding begins to creep in
	as I cauterize bleeding tendrils
	I am an ape with a screwdriver
	using it like a hammer 
	my mind is elsewhere
	but soon it dawns
	the veil is lifted
	no more errors
	
	I want to test more,
	but the presence of so much "working"
	makes it arduous to ferret out the "not working"
	you would have to be somewhat pathological to break this code
	unfortunately, most users are.

	I chewed paper towel spit into my nasal passage
	making me smell drowning while I say
	"Come on" to the error I got from playing too fast and loose 
	I'm trying to figure out why this all seems so profound to me.

	waiting while valgrind churns
	and tripping on context switches
	each oversight adds a half an hour
	conclusion: it's not in our code

	(whomsoever said insanity is doing the same thing
	and expecting a different result 
	obviously was not a programmer)
</pre>
<h1>0x6  Medium Rare </h1>
<pre>
	Blue wizard needs food badly
	I'm starving to death with ramen in arms reach
	because eating would mean removing my hands from the keyboard

	I pause my music
	when I see that evil red eye blink.
	This call might be for me.
	Unpause.

	Breadth-first
	I am shaving the Sahara to bedrock
	a depth of one grain of sand at a time
	The context-switching is killing me.
	Breathless, heart races to feel so close to so many goals
	Letting pseudo-ADD dictate what I do. 
	Caber tossing toothpicks.

	zombie process, attempting to recharge
	running in place.
	In a world with no north
	the only thing for a compass to do is spin.
	
	Not enough time to digest all my sensory inputs
	not enough interneurons to parallelize the process
	and so my motor neurons fire 
	and fire without knowing why
	I envy those who only burn their candle at two ends

	I can feel the sickness creep into my face.
	Capillaries filling with it.
	Stress ore melted down into pure nervousness. 
	This presentation won't be rote.  I'm not prepared.
	Takes my weakest heart and puts it in my chest.

	Tech support sometimes make me do a little dance of despair.
	Then I sit on the floor for a while
	and make faces. 
	
	I get homesick for that place
	On the phone I feel like an impostor
	a project or two consume me, quell me
	and I ooze back into a more natural composition

	soft breeze brings smell of asphalt and just a little dirt
	feels like living
	how can the office conjure such a counterfeit of life?
	It's an elevator between floors
	like playing a game in slow motion or pause.
	a good day doesn't leave you feeling like you're fresh from quitting smoking
	eyes crispy-crunching (running out of new ways to describe it)
	I love my job, but hate to work
	time for a change of scene or pace
	when it becomes a less playful place
	it hurts to be in Hell knowing Heaven is so close by.
	the hack is armor
	each interruption a laceration, an assault on my serenity
	down to zero, nay negative structural integrity
	I hate to waste time, but I need to decompress
	keep playing Speed Queen from MC Frontalot
	more than twenty times today.
	this little routine makes the day seem more continuous
	I know coffee can put me back on track
	but that track leads straight to a wall
	crash.

	The second wind is the best.
	That's what I've been waiting for. 
	But if I use up all the air allocated to this week
	I'll just be sucking vacuum 'til weekend.

	It's a sequence of black and white
	in a trance or mind in mud
	I play, I play with relish and fervor
	for hours, for days I play
	neglecting sleep and food
	but I stop just short of work
	I take an idea as far as it carries me
	when it tires and asks that I carry it I find a new one
	there is no shortage of novel and wondrous things
	and maybe at night or weeks gone by an old idea finds new life
	and carries me further
</pre>
<h1> 0x7  Encryption </h1>
<pre>
	it does just feel wrong
	to have consciousness seated in one place
	the mind feels as though its nature is ubiquity 
	begging for liberation

	there is no such thing as security 
	when playful guys with wandering eyes
	decide to make your data their prize
	spiders encroach, biting softish spots
	get slapped around by an oafish hand
	retreat to their home, the spider web
	where meaty things have lost their stand
	becoming bugs without a chance
</pre>
<h1>0x8  Recreation</h1>
<pre>
	Snakes on a plane on Saturday.
	Bought Snow Crash to re-read it.
	A surreal trip to the mall.
	Rich-people type of hangout
	I pass a half a dozen jewelry stores
	pretty people, pricks in suits
	I move like a robot with determination.
	hideout in the book store
	then make my escape

	Power out from Sunday afternoon, Still out Tuesday morning.
	Walking around my neighborhood Monday evening.
	A man, I can't tell whether he asks "how" or "hell" I'm doing. 
	Cheerfully I responded and daggers he looked back at me.
	I look a shambles, shady in this coat
	and with the Guinness down the gullet

	My life is like those old-school text games (Zork or HHGG)
	&gt;d
	You enter the basement.  It is dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
	You see: computer, bag of chips 
	Exits: Upstairs, South
	&gt;use computer
	
	sometimes I unlock a secret level
	but I work within the system.
	the rooms are very limited
	I can't create new exits
	go back home, to a store.
	I feel the game has no end
	no point at which I can sit back
	watch the credits roll by and think
	"Well, now that that's done I can sit back and relax here on out" 
	and it feels like the twitcher minigames
	have overwhelmed the adventure aspect

	I step outside and soon find a genuine smile on my face
	hard to be cranky encased in such beautiful weather
	overcast, warm, not yet raining
	cool breeze, the smell of earth
	plants beginning to recover from the stun of winter
	a coffee in my hand I put to my nose and smell
	taking a break from a job on summer vacation
	remembering relaxing with a cigarette
	my whole attitude improves
	
	Walking back from the mail box
	I see a pair of ducks waddling through my yard
	I think some kid in the ditch just called me fat
	I can only see his/her head.
	fuzzy at this distance
	"I'm joking, I swear. I thought you were someone else"

	I love the flash of hand-held lightning
	a buzz brushing against the TV set
	static electricity in the dark
	car seat hair fuzz blanket

	Saturday. I sneak off to work upon waking
	then to the bank to cash some bonds
	I still feel strange in leather jacket
	home is a shell that I am avoiding
	reading on the deck my neighbor raking behind me.
	We've never exchanged a word
	Motorcycle, Castle Wood. The day has warmed.
	bare feet on sharp rocks
	focus on the pain distracts me from
	I pause and reflect on the bench near the edge of the cliff
	five hawks circling overhead
	the hunter birds have always held a special place in my heart
	I say nothing and saying it brings such profound joy
	to say it so clearly to the people walking past me
	I try out a knowing smile that says 'yes, I am human too'
	but this is all that we have in common
	moving on.
	I start to wonder why I am so enamored of this path.
	descending, then back up. as I recrest it hits me.
	the view opens up, unblocked by trees
	river, woods, a glade
	sitting on a smooth table rock
	long trains pass by, one full of coal
	a little brown lizard runs across my fingertips
	
	beasts under my deck are snarling and scrambling
	biting in darkness just a few feet from my eyes
	and I can't see any of it
	the sound is surreal given my state of mind
	but grating, somehow bypasses mental defenses
	hits a tender spot
	the spring air smells full of promise
	I stagger, stumble away from it

	Sunday morning. Shower.
	Drive. Mall.
	Walk. A veering dance 
	with an oncoming grey-haired woman
	we smile.
	locked doors, paranoia. I turn around
	and seem to follow her a while
	Drive. City. Hills.
	Rolling landscape
	a little desolate, but beautiful, quaint
	a coupla hicks, a redneck
	green punctuated by purple blossoms
	Is that a golf course on the left?
	I pull into a country club
	Mansions and BMWs.
	Cars worth more than...
	worth a lot.
	turning around
	Mall. Bookstore.
	Browsing
	He sees me kneeling in 'p'
	asks "Proust?"
	Is that a question or a challenge?
	I respond "Just a little Pynchon today,
	but I'm not sure"
	I think he says "B"
	makes me a little nervous
	or is it the cute girl at the end of the aisle?
	I leave.
	Car. Writing.
	Beautiful weather now that the sun has risen
	should take the bike out today
	find a park, enjoy.
	I feel unsure, hold a wry smile in reserve.
	I go home and play Cooking Mama the rest of the day.

	Grooves and gradients.
	Falling into familiar patterns.
	Trying to rend myself from the rut.
	I want to be little.  Smaller than I am.
	To fit inside the hole and complete myself.
	fire consumes me as I consume it.  ouroboros again.
	hell is repetition.  yes, I say again.  hell is repetition. 

	I want to flee, but I don't have a destination
	this yard is a prison with the razor wire in my head
	I feel like I'm relaxing with malice
	always choosing the lesser of two agitations

	every man is indeed an island.
	no matter how truly, madly, deeply one may connect.
	ears, eyes, and hands are an ocean compared
	to the land of axons dendrites and soma

	Still water is a mirror and my face a skeleton's
	tell me what it is that lies outside this port
	which sounds are sweet and which are awful
	describe the song that the sirens sing
	that make a man happy to drown

	I've lost the wanderlust
	without feeding it anything
	let it starve to death, I guess
</pre>
<h1>0x9  Evening</h1>
<pre>
	A little world: 
	cubicle and basement.
	Emotionally distant
	I feel like I know this code 
	better than I know my own family.
	I don't know how to debug emotions
	can't grep the source of my feelings

	Drink some more to kiss the clouds
	End up with a face full of space
	Hide in pain's back yard
	Hidden in plain sight
	Not hidden at all
	
	home alone. I feel unworthy
	but I feel free, sublime
	heaven and hell are at my fingertips
	just a twitch away. 
	I am effectively invisible, insubstantial
	but digitally omniscient, omnipresent
	all that I care about is 
	a little smile, a few happy neurons 
	Dancing between delight and depression
	Oscillating
	
	I think I need to enhance the capability to mop my floor
	and start spec'ing out this addition to my cleaning module
	and then I realize this is not normal English for "buy a bucket"

	Enjoying my new periodic table shower curtain
	Au that glitters is gold
	when I lie down relaxing in the bath, vanilla bubbles
	I study the conversions
	Liters to pints, kilometers to inches

	Nimble and yet...
	How hoary I feel with a taut, dry face. 
	a shadow behind my eye
	I crouch and clutch myself
	rock back and forth
	reach out my hand
	to grasp at the sand falling from the hour glass
	to stuff it back into the top
	because I just want to take a breath
	to relax and let it go
	so I refocus and obsess over the mundane
	Truth comes in trace amounts.
	Meager parts per million.
	Words and words
	scribble then strike through the strikethoughts
	on the back of envelopes
	a morsel of manifesto, a chunk of thesis
	trying to piece it all together into a coherent whole
	an attempt to be something better than I am

	Oh, I daren't divulge such administrivia 
	such as this was and this is and this will be.
	tonight I will dine on unicorn steak
	and pick my teeth with the horn
</pre>
<h1>0xA  Darkness</h1>
<pre>
	a world measured then in meters is now in decameters
	my thimble of pain has become a flagon.
	my lizard of hope a dragon (compiler design)
	star-burning eyes of my shining night.
	in a castle that is a den with untold riches
	in chests that cannot be unlocked

	Arrive before it rises, leave after it sets
	There are cloudless days that I never see the sun.
	
	Some times I'm afraid of the dark
	and other times it's afraid of me
	There is nothing there then
	that isn't there in the light
	but blindness makes your mind more free
	to see the things you cannot see.
 
	Last night my sleep was punctuated by
	nightmares that occurred only when I was awake 
	I was trapped in execution
	Not a hangman's but a program's
	
	I tried to kill it 
	</pre>
	<p>	<img src="KillNightmare.jpg" alt="Kill Nightmare"/>	</p>
	<pre>
	an extra laugh, the source code was:
	int main() {
		   while (1) { 
				   sleep();
		   }
	}
	Aye, there's the rub
	For in that infinite loop what calls may come
	when my process has shuffled off this digital coil
		
	the smell of asphalt on a rainy Friday night
	fifty five degrees. feels like freedom
	one window open as I drive down the road
	results in the helicopter sound
	subtle dull thuds to mirror my heart
	
	blowing kisses to the night
	keeping my distance as her makeup starts to run
	exposing laugh lines (we'll call for the sake of mercy)
	I eventually collapse in her arms to escape 
	the nagging of my wife the day
	I whisper 'te amo' but I hardly mean it
	her eyes they still twinkle 
	but alas, the spark is gone
	quenched by my cold, remorseless indifference
	to charms shared with far too many men
	too many poets twilight does court
	too many lovers she's had
	to look upon those lips with lust
	
	too much traffic so I turn right where I want to go left
	pull into an apartment parking lot
	voices. I hear voices.
	sounds like a party in progress
	
	I head home and exit her embrace 
	and step inside the house
	
	sipping Grandaddy's whiskey from stemware 
	the microwaved egg rolls give me greasy fingers
	
	I am a shadow, surrounded
	the walls are lies I tell myself to stay placid
	flaccid hopes and failed dreams of normalcy. 
	a bright tomorrow tossed to my disease, my decay.
	pain has become a dear friend,
	but I don't want to play dead any longer.
	day doesn't forgive the scent of night on me
	she slaps me, rebukes me, rejects me
	and so though the sun does shine
	I do not enter day's domain
	cowering in the basement
	I pantomime a kiss with a counterfeit moon
	counting hours on gnarled fingers
	eagerly awaiting evening's return
	nine p.m. a cursory glance in my direction
	and I am rejected again
	night comes. alone.
	
	the hardest part is holding back.  I strain in silence
	pain in the stomach keeps my head on the ground
	I touch my face with the hand that is soft
	to wipe away the thoughts that are dark
	I touch my coffee cup the same way.
	it makes me close my eyes
	and whisper good night
	then fall asleep
