<h1>DefCon15</h1>
<h2> Thursday </h2>
<pre>
	I park in the back, a cove off the main lot
	in the shelter waiting for the shuttle
	a moment of quiet meditation 

	This driver is more high strung than the last (Seattle)
	rapid jerky movements shakes his head
	rolls his eyes as the lady looking like Ms. Landingham 
	struggles with her bag, says that she's still waking and "unfolding my body"
	"Aww, poor thing. We'll be your friend, if only for the bus ride."
	Then she reads my shirt to her drowsy, confused companion.

	through the metal detector "Hello David" security says
	reading my boarding pass.
	"Just Another... Sad Robot... With no friends"
	reading my shirt
	"Aww, that's sad."

	waiting with two hours to go.
	two kids sit next to me, watching planes take off
	"There's one in the sky!" their enthusiasm is infectious
	"A big one" I turn and see it through his eyes and smile
	the father comes over. I offer my seat, he declines
	"There are many states in the United States"
	I'm reading Gravity's Rainbow.
	the line "hostile to bananas" fills me with joy.
	A man on the phone:
	"Give me 'til the end of next week 
	and we'll decide who we can keep and who we can let go.
	I understand (x10) Give me to the end of next week." 
	Developers on the chopping block. Sad.

	arrive in Vegas, take a cab to hotel. 
	Phone my brother from the registration line (long and stagnant)
	H20 &amp; Snowman are just ahead, they call me over. 
	quickly catching up. new hair, new job?
	Cenobyte and Cygnus still at large 
	line moves, we get badges. 
	Check in to the hotel.
	the norms still hold court here so we walk the strip a little
	Duck into some casinos, pick up some supplies
	Red Bull (do you think a 12 pack will be enough?)
	and Booze (SoCo, plum sake)
	back to the Riviera for some Quiznos
	the hacker crowd is starting to congeal
	congregate, milling about
	the norms envy us our badges
	asking what they're about
	(Some kind of Star Wars thing?)

	some rain so they close the pool
	(don't want people outside, getting wet)

	Rammstein playing, a stage being set up
	Security hassles some guys for laptoping

	we head to the bar, listening to people like astcell
	Brother talks consoles with Squidly1 and beer backpack
	some goons. kicking up a ruckus. gotta love it.
	left me holding a match 
	goons makes you feel loved 
	in that creepy uncle type of way
	he offers to rape my ear 

	"You need a handle. We'll call you Tweedle dee and Tweedle dum"
	"I got a computer for Christmas"
	"I still use a typewriter"
	we're killing time, racking up interaction skill points
	guy decides he's a pimp. five dollars for her, ten for him
	"They aren't going to pay ten dollars for you, 
	I don't know why you came over here"
	Speakers making strange noise. "Do you think that's us?" "Yeah"

	around the corner H20&amp;SnowMan are talking about business
	taking it to the next level

	walk the circuit again. past the pool
	Red Dwarf t-shirt wearer sitting on a balcony
	words are fuzzing, ability to speak: fading
	we head to the Pepper Mill in pursuit of food.
</pre>
<h2> Friday </h2>
<pre>
	we check out the sky boxes (they are supposed to be open by now)
	sitting by a group with a guy that looks like Wes from 3 Dead Trolls
	talking about operating systems, working for phone companies
	"My Shit's on default" has too many letters for the badge
	get caught in a crowd downstairs. 

	first talk. Joe Grand on the DefCon Badge
	I'm surrounded by freaks, phreaks, hackers
	"This is how hardware guys code" on a United napkin

	stick around for Q&amp;A with Bruce Schneier
	"breaking NSA is like breaking Alien tech"
	Even if the cryptography sucks, something else sucks more

	Hit the Vendor area. Drool over some hardware.
	buy some caffeinated mints

	to the skyboxes. check out lockpick village
	soak up some knowledge
	I've played with picks before, but I lack dexterity 
	"you look starry-eyed" she says to me
	I'm looking at the enigma emulator
	in progress, schematics

	browse through contest area, check out the dunk tank
	robots with guns. Monty Python movies.
	damn this place has it all.

	watching the vids in the capture the flag area 
	(my favorite is "le grand content")
	splitting a "Hello My Name is Fuck You" sticker 
	to cover up the components on the back of the badge
	"Do you want a fuck or a you?" 

	Information. Like a gas it fills the space
	We're pondering the trade-off between privacy and the social benefits of data mining
	I'm in a sweet spot of lucid and drunk
	where everything I think is faux-eloquent

	We meet a man with the last name of Hacker.
	He pulls out his ID to show us. 
	Had a drink maybe too many. Leaves his glass behind.
	This culture of crazy is spoiling me... 

	To a Johnny Long talk. No Tech Hacking. 
	"It's not like they just go missing"

	Security in the elevator asks us "Are you the good guys?"
	We say "yeah" and laugh

	watching Infest Wisely. mini vikings, saving the world.
	put together with 700 dollars and love. 

	popping into the rave/ball. seems a little repetitive
	Nice energy, pretty lights (but I prefer a nice mosh pit)
	Up to the sky boxes. Ushered in to i-hacked.com
	"Why do I know you? I never forget a face."

	noise, noise and glow.
	waiting for the muse, the amusing
	we get to drinking.
	So far, the curve of the plot of fun has the shape of log(t)
	an large initial increase in fun, but rapidly approaching an asymptote
	caffeine provides a scalar increase in magnitude along the y-axis, 
	but does not affect the slope of the plot
	alcohol represents an inflection point 
	fun is now experiencing polynomial growth
	the tone of our conversations change.

	we head back to the long bar.
	chatting with the filmmakers of Infest Wisely
	writer, sci-fi. text games (like Zork) punk points, right on.
	'Zine scene. Berlin, CCC. loving to see cities in decay
	they're shooting machine guns tomorrow

	dropping more stimulants to keep sensation alive
	a shotgun filled with fun is aimed at my face
	but I'm getting too old for this. 
	asleep around 2.

</pre>
<h2> Saturday </h2>
<pre>
	up at various times. four, five. 
	left leg paralyzed, get some ice.
	final up at 7 crack a window, write a little
	reminiscing on the recent past, 
	pressing rewind while it's still (crescent) fresh
	trying to capture the past, aware of the present, shaping the future

	Def Con Vibe: Hack it all. A liberation so rare. 
	I miss it already and I'm still here

	to a talk on Hacking the Brain with Video Games
	waiting for it to start we're killing zombies on the PSP with a green Elvis 
	Beatles playing on the PA
	pink dread locks on stage (definitely in the top ten of best hair)
	The demo machine is with Customs since
	heart rate monitor equals terrorism

	Spend the day in talks and wandering
	tcp/ip drinking game. these are some astoundingly smart guys

	Hacker Jeopardy, lots of fun
	they're missing some easy questions
	we have to heckle these guys for not knowing Ohm's law
	then we're let loose to wander some more. 
	find Aestetix and hang out an the prototype hacker space
	wii hax0r avatar wearing black 
	and we fail to crash the Ninja party
	to the penthouse where security issues a vaguely veiled threat
	I guess they don't want us this high after last year's incident

</pre>
<h2> Sunday </h2>
<pre>
	Up near 7, wobbly and weak
	fuel spent, damage bent
	Let my brother sleep while I get hash browns and apple juice
	fragments of memory here are written in water
	sluice through my head
	Q&amp;A talk on guns (the Infest Wisely guys sitting near us)
	to the skybox to catch the HackaDay t-shirts 
	surprisingly restrained, but it's a good thing we got there early
	
	I'm so tired my eyes have lag
	I turn my head and the scene catches up at leisure
	
	Closing ceremonies.
	Tkes and norms shift in, geeks shift out
	night falls
	to circus circus "Is this not a reasonable place to park?"
	Ryan's work calls.  Their internet is down.
	"DefCon broke the internet"
	every casino is the same.  Machines, stores, crass consumerism
	readjusting to seeing normal people
	and unhacked terminals
	walking down the strip
	Tahiti employee punk rocks to my safety pin
	rockin' out to old school clash, weezer, AFI.  
	the plaza with the big screens
	we bump into the Canadian filmmakers. 
	They're making their way to Fremont street.
	They recommend the Venetian again
	and so we head there

	In comments we rehash our favorite talks
	squeezing past the crowded TI scene 
	(calculator jokes, how nerdy can you get?)
	describing the holdup in networking terms
	severe lag, DOS the sidewalk, timeouts, TTL
	towards the end of the crowd someone has vomited

	step into Margaritaville, a glimpse of Bellagio fountains
	The city has quite the panache, but so superficial.
	We make it to Paris and start to head back
	Elvis says to me "I like your style"
</pre>
<h2> Monday </h2>
<pre>
	in the morning I'm making more notes on my plan for mating code
	combining my bioinformatics experience with Hacker interests
	checkout and head to the Hilton, Star Trek experience 
	(which earlier I had described as faux geek)
	head north some, searching for food.
	take the tram from Sahara to MGM
	catch the group of casinos in that area
	We're amused, but largely unimpressed.

	walk to the airport.  
	past desert, cactus near a deadly fence
	dozens of cut-up credit cards, failed dreams
	heck of a trek, but we made it.
	crazy early.  killing zombies and time
	we split to go through security (I'm C gate and he's D)

	we're a bit worried our circuits will be considered contraband
	they rescan my bag, a lump in my throat
	what spooked them turned out to be the book
	(to be fair there's a picture of a bomb on the cover)
	my flight is delayed, some people dismayed.  I'm dozing
	guy sitting next to me trying to sync his device
	"If only I could find a geek..."
	"The guy next to you is smiling.  Maybe you should ask him"
</pre>
<h2> Tuesday </h2>
<pre>
	arrive home ~3am
	don't want to go to work today
	it should be a DefCon play day
	but it turns out alright
	nice to be back in the saddle, programming.  mental guns ablaze
