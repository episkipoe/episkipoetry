	John R Reynolds
	I've seen pictures of him young and handsome, WWII
	memorabilia he told us he took from Hitler's train
	selling lemonade at a garage sale in his front yard
	the sign he wrote for us
	"ice cold lemonade
	made in the shade
	stirred with a spade"
	nickels in the bank made from little yellow chicken liver tub
	always had cookies above the fridge in faded Tupperware
	"You're gonna eat me out of house and home" 
	He'd enjoy a big warm glass of buttermilk in the tall glass with Bears helmet
	visited our kindergarten class dressed as Santa and I didn't know it was him
	The Zip Cord he built us leading from the old tractor to the orchard
	hill with pedal powered cars, forts in the woods
	"Don't fall and break a hole in the ground"
	Owls in the back yard he'd stun with lights
	The day he picked me up from school when I got sick 
	and we watched Predator (Predatator, extra emphasis on the Tator)
	Hi Ho Feedle Bum.  Bah Humbug he'd bellow 
	A world class grump, but such a kind and gentle man.  Helpful and happy.
	cashews remind me of him, his claw
	an infected nail that he would cut with a hack saw
	it would bleed
	and he would save the clippings.  planned to make a necklace out of them.
	Asplundh, orange sweatshirts, Hap Hazard, tree climbing boots
	Fischer paper products.  Pop corn bags and hot dogs.
	bon fires in the back yard, forks on the end of poles
	Concerts of ours he'd attend
	Parades, Realtors giving away free food "You can't beat that price"
	the handyman bond he had with my dad.  pack rats and power tools
	the fishing bond with Ryan, cub scouts and lakes.  camping
	canoeing on the river.  power strokes
	the squirrel circus in the front yard
	mixture sandwiches few besides I could appreciate
	he'd put skittles in gorp.
	borrowing artifacts for school projects.  antlers
	pilgrims and indians. a collection of elaborate hats
	The big bushy eyebrows, a dramatic shock of white hair
	business card holder with my name in his handwriting
	a wide golden scrawl 
	the cursive pages of questions for me when I returned from my Virginia fieldtrip
	Spending time at the farm of his brother Earl
	Taking pictures of me with a Fat Pig so that he could remember which was which
	Fire trucks in the back yard, we were looking for the sub rumored to be there
	chasing peacocks.  the time a llama spit on me, I got peed on by a goat.
	graduation party sitting in a chair with a can of sody catching bees
	songs like swanee river, waltzing matilda
	and the decline, hospital.  "I like to eat people"
	the picture I drew with a lake.  a frog and a log
	the nurse thought I misspelled it, 
	but we really did call him Grumpa
	Spanish class, freshman year college
	talking about what happened over the summer
	Hanging up the phone I woke my brothers to give them the news
	it took weeks to clean up a lifetime of clutter, clutter peanut butter
	we found cans of used paper towels and other treasures
	My mom in tears at the end of Big Fish and Walk the Line
	because they remind her of him
	a picture of him in the stairwell of my new home
	Aunt Kim comments "now your friends know why you're so weird"
