1820 I'm chided for leaving early
"Aren't you always the last to leave?"
"I have somewhere to go"
driving with windows open
it has turned out to be a beautiful spring day
through the trendy part of town
to Mad Art to see Penny Arcade
a stone's throw from the brewery
the hoppy smell hangs heavy in the air
the nursery of beer, the angel's share
I've rarely seen real hipsters drinking PBR
semi-mythical creatures from Diesel Sweeties
I'm nervous for no reason
there's a bartender in the front of the room
I buy a book and buy a beer
and start to drink them in
two thirds through the bottle heave a contented sigh
settle into my skin
the room is filling up with gamers in novelty t-shirts
all here to see
eager and erudite
children and craftsmen
a jovial, jolly misanthrope
and the world's nicest asshole
the room erupts in laughter, another penis joke

Sitting in the steampunk section
Walk the perimeter looking at the comics hanging on the walls
Cardboard Tube Samurai with no words, just a slice of a scene
The electric sheep noir of Automata
but my favorite by far is the absurdity of Twisp and Catsby
