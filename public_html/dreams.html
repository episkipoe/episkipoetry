	(4/23/07)
	A genuine pillow->marshmallow moment
	I wake at 3am (finding my fist in the air)
	from a dream in which I'm decapitating someone
	
	(09/25/07)
	one where I'm singing along with Pavarotti in a grocery store
	climbing on stacks of cases of soda

	(5/10/08)
	A dream that I was the slave of a nomad in an African desert
	He was a pitiful thing, his goat ate its own feces
	I ran away.  to the house I grew up in.
	He begged me to come back.
	Matt Groenig begged me to come back.
	And then I died.
	They put me on the couch at my Grandmother's house.
	Family gathered around, children running, playing.
	I started to return from the dead
	still wracked by rigor mortis and brain damage.
	Friggin' zombies.

	(10/17/08)
	follow your dreams they say
	but these dreams are hard to follow
	I am a viking on a small boat
	freeing the steering column from ice with an axe
	shink, shink, shink, thud
	and the rudder is moving, the man shouts
	but he is bleeding and we are attacked by sharks
	small ones at first, I punch them with my fist
	but then a big one bites our boat in half
	and I am alone on a jungle island
	attacked by a huge tortoise
	I am an elephant and tiny by comparison
	and then he jumps in the water and is a whale
	and I am a shark and I bite him
	next is a room with shadow
	and I am invisible, killing men
	then attacked by dogs, probably demonic
	I shout sanctuary and I am in the vault of a bank
	with gold and jewels and the banker comes down
	I try to explain why I am here, it feels like home
	and I hand him a bag of saint's bones
	and court his beautiful daughter
	I have never been so disappointed by waking

	(06/16/09)
	2am. awakened by a dream
	like an episode of the twilight zone
	houses that keep changing appearance
	and kids in masks that are not masks
	an old cellphone sitting on a fridge
	now sitting in the top row of the bleachers
	with college friends at a baseball game in Cuba
	the Cubans are playing the Soviets
	and now I'm in a bar in Ireland
	but they won't serve me
	I'm trying to order beer from the DJ

	(1/23/10)
	I wake this morning from a woman's scream in my dream
	I had just touched the cover of the diary of a man with the initials HH
	in big black letters on a pocket-sized book
	sitting on the large, ornate mantle of a fire place
	on the stage left wall of a small sitting room
	the walls are round grey stone
	I could not see the woman; the sound came from around the corner, back
	and stage right
	she had seen something or was attacked - one piercing shrill sound,
	loud as I could imagine
	she is a servant or a maid, was wearing an apron and carrying a tray
	the last time I saw her
	in the back of the room a portrait hangs, the color of the man's hair
	matches the stone
	a dark red settee faces the fireplace, sitting on a bright red rug
	in the forefront of the scene there is a pulpit
	there is a book lying on the shelf in the pulpit
	an unholy gospel, written by HH
	each of the chapters references an animal and has a small drawing of it
	before walking to the fire place I had the book open to the canine section
	the drawing was definitely a wolf, fangs bared, but I seem to recall
	alliteration with the letter D in the chapter title
	HH is deceased.  allegedly.  his presence hangs heavy in the room
	after I wake I swear I see his shadow pass by my doorway
