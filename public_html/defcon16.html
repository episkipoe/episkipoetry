<h1> DefCon16 </h1>
<h2> Thursday </h2>
<pre>
	Sunny day, eager anticipation for this new adventure
	Santa drives the shuttle bus
	the AC hums and a child intones "we're moving, we're moving"

	Security asks "What have you got in your bag?  Candy?"
	I dunno, I mumble under my breath
	"Oh, Slim Fast bars.  Very Nutritious"
	My skull-shoes have failed to follow me - too light

	Kid in a preppy shirt reclines and talks loudly on his cell phone
	An older gentleman in a red shirt with his wife - they both seem dour
	on the phone he comes alive 
	hangs up phone and is curt again
	she says something about the Olympics
	his reply is characterized by politeness, impersonal and uninterested	
	his phone rings and he is jovial once more

	"A representative from the American Bagel Company is needed outside security"
	behind my head some girls chatter, just turned 21
	blond and raucous, up late dancing last night, now making club plans
	"I got tired just watching you"
	the father has a drawl and once had a gall stone
	my head is buried in my book and I wince when I listen

	enter the plane
	the woman next to me offers 5 dollars to the screaming kid to shut it up
	and a drink to anyone who silences it
	"I'll buy you a drink" she says to the girl who happens to be seventeen
	and she offers to buy me a drink for the hell of it 
	her husband throws the horns - we're headed to a party town
	they've gone through 8 mini-bottles of Vodka and a couple of beers
	she calls me "genius computer guy" and says I'm the perfect seatmate

	Okay.  I'm in the hotel now.  Safe from the Norms.
	But what is this, in the elevator?
	He asks us what Def Con is
	"It's a hacker convention"
	"A hacker what?"
	"A whole bunch of hackers get together"
	"Oh man, you guys are gonna get arrested"
	
	We drop off our bags and then pick up supplies
	crossing the street frogger-style
	SD Card, Red Bull, SoCo, Gatorade, Vodka
	back in the room, testing the TV B Gone of the badge
	plug the laptop into the alarm clock and rock out to some techno

	wandering, wandering - bumping into some familiar faces
	slap some high fives and then we merge with the Chicago crew
	up in the room we've strewn out suitcases full of equipment
	10 of us hacking - coding, soldering, and cracking crypto
	one has trouble tethering the phone - re error code 67
	Wild Jaku has decided that I'm his kindred spirit
	"You know what I'm talking about"
	We've decided to get the Legend membership to Pole Position
	$4999 for a year of unlimited racing
	The fire tossing guy that we see from the window briefly lights his shorts on fire	

	My brother goes to sleep since he's had a long day
	I find Cenobyte and we're talking about Physics	
	my head spins with a comfortable euphoria
	and I start to explain bioinformatics
	and we find a guy who does proteomics
	He regales us regarding dangerous lab stuff
	(sometimes sans pants)
	listening to techno in the common area
 
</pre>
<h2> Friday </h2>
<pre>
	Although I know I'm here now I feel like 
	Sir Real, the Knight of Day
	shower and change
	As I'm leaving the room our neighbor enters his, heading for bed	
	I sketch out a rough schedule and watch some talks

	I talk with Scott (who spoke on BLAST and ASM) 
	and inspired me to play with SNPs and ASM 
	genetic and computer code - scientific crosstalk

	Joe Grand and Hacking in the name of science
	playing ping pong for research and dancing ninja attack

	Sitting in Kevin and Marco's talk
	I enjoy absorbing their energy and knowledge 

	Buy caffeinated mints from the vendor area
	(I'm making it a tradition)
	something to beat off the whore that is night

	Listening in the Quantum demonstration
	quite interesting but I'm starting to feel faded
	in and out of sync	

	Visiting the skyboxen and the LockPickZone  is packed too dense
	In the Hardware Hacking Village Joe Grand recaps his talk
	and I get a little look at the poem in the bootlooder
	Making a note to check it out on the CD

	watching TCP/IP and Hacker jeopardy
	I'm getting drunk with hackers - Brother's thermos has rubber grips
	never underestimate the necessity of viscosity in a high velocity drinking situation

	Jesus calls as we recharge and so we head out
	step into the mouth of fearsome noise and smoke
	"I'm in hacker Hell" guy says as his compatriot starts holy wars
	from Star Trek to Distros - loud and obnoxious in that endearing way
	the drunk fucker that grabs your shoulder and amuses you
	Circus Circus is out the window; gonna hack that clown
	making fun of Vista then someone mentions a relative with ME
	"Why does it keep crashing?"  "Well, you're using Windows ME"

	watching the guy rock the dot around last year's badge
	"I'm proud of myself" he says (and it truly is a righteous hack)

	and in the corner catching pockets of quiet
	Claudus is talking on art and ASP

	my voice is harsh and I'm low on talk
	but high on listen, light-headed
	with a clipboard and a hard-hat
	to protect me from the linguistic gymnastics
	"I've budgeted for a whore - have you played Warcraft III?"
	
	And I observe the strange transition, how a room transforms
	starting as white noise, visually veiled
	with familiarity faces start to form 
	songs and voices become recognizable

	my head is bowed to paper so I'm shifting
	from neural storm to a real live party to my own personal world
	I am separate but receptive - warmed by the heat of voices
	someone is talking about dot net and emacs
	Fish and Jesus serving drinks and the chandelier shakes precarious
	soulful eyes and starry skies the night beat back with a mighty hack
	see another sage, flip the page.  lost another pen, I start again
	circular reasoning spinning in this intellectual cul de sac
	I am confronted - "taking notes make people like us nervous"
	I show him some words and he says I'm alright
	but still bashful I put away my clipboard

	Brother is swapping stories with a goon
	"My job is to make sure you have a good time"
	but I don't have any good whore-r type stories to tell
	"Your brother makes me a happy drunk.  You are making me an irate drunk"
	And so after a while I rail on my side projects
	I talk of C code and biology and other familiar things
	amino acids and op codes, of sequences and strings
	it isn't considered interesting
	not in this place at this time
		
</pre>
<h2> Saturday </h2>
<pre>
	I wake up with only a vague notion of what day it is 
	and where I am and no idea where my brother is
	the other bed contains only a laptop
	phone call goes unanswered
	I later learn that he's alive
	just never went to sleep

	I spend the day in talks
	knowing that it's not the talks that make the con
	they frame the canvas and the canvas is the people

	wearing my shirt with the phylogenic tree 
	go far enough back in your family tree 
	and you're related to rats and trees

	G. Mark walks around before the talk
	shaking hands, a charismatic gentleman
	I'm smacked in the face with a t-shirt	
	"He isn't awake yet"

	talks on video games and brains stimulate the neurons

	and I'm musing on the algorithm
	Introduce yourself to a subset of the population
	For each person P maximize time spent 
	based on their knowledge and congeniality
	
	Sitting in the chillout area
	a crack in progress to my left
	to my right a pair trying to get hacked
	and you have to take a vacation to get the perfect work environment
	drink in one hand, DJ in the background, and thousands of smart geeks around

	I like the Ubuntu Dragon background at the solid state talk
	and then we're watching Hacker jeopardy and it's worth some laughs
	Yes, sir.  We have achieved epic levels of lulz.

	The Chicago crew is still chewing on LosT puzzles
	"I want to stab a baby now"
	and the "You know what I'm talking about" meme has spread
	"I don't even need to say it anymore"

	I'm losing lucidity, brain bleeding
	body zombie jerks
	eyes open, brain shut down
	stuck somewhere in the occipital

	security runs down the hallway
	and a gaggle of freaks stroll by
	how it warms my heart to see them	

	I'm tired, but afraid that if I put head to pillow
	I will find out that now is the dream
	because this feels better than real 

	You push it too hard, up 'til four or more
	the sun it rises unforgiving
	but "Hell Yah"  it rocks
	and you never quite recover
	cause you keep it full throttle
	as a consequence it unseats your core
	(toaster computer using bread as a heat sink)
	and then "Oh Noes" your eyes burst into flame
	and you need to close them, to douse them with water
	now I'm very light-headed - a charred husk in zombie horde
	and it's totally fucking worth it
	because it is universally unique and lovely beyond words 
</pre>

<h2> Sunday </h2>
<pre>
	early morning 
	the carpet zamboni drives through an otherwise empty hallway
	sitting by the pool waiting for critical mass to return
	too early to start drinking?
	but thoughts are more intoxicating
	is it, therefore, too early to start thinking
	petty truisms, but words are free and ink is cheap 
	take any familiar pattern far enough and it becomes novel
	talk about it with someone new and get a fresh perspective
	sitting by the pool - fading in and out
	I notice the palm trees and my concept of location changes
	I jump from Def Con to headspace to Las Vegas then back inside
	and the Wackenhut badge walks by - what an oddly appropriate name
	grab yer billy club and come on down to the Wackenhut

	sitting on a bench listening to Mouse give a preview of her talk
	and I recognize the cadence - the speed and the beat 
	of a smart person talking on a familiar topic
	and here you don't have to dumb it down

	Kaminsky naturally draws quite a crowd
	and we spill across the hall to see Renderman
	and learn about hacking Internet Kiosks and billboards

	it really is inspiring
	planning tools and frameworks
	to get my ideas into hands like these

	At the closing ceremonies it is requested that I impersonate Todd
	who won the Guitar Hero contest and was kicked out for Goatse
	Chicago crew flashes the ceiling with their shiny Def Con ball

	At the Dennys the waitress lays it thick with the honeys and sweeties
	Asks if we're here for Star Trek and we rail on the "fuckin' nerds"
	riding the remains of the high laughing all the while.
	then my brother heads to the airport

	I'm sitting on the floor
	a goofy guy with a grin collecting nods
	most days a hundred walk by that don't understand
	but here a skull-shirt explains that java ruins the kids
	and they don't consider the big oh complexity of their algorithms

	the novelty has faded and the armor is down - chipped away by booze 
	and the reassurance that yes, here you are among your kind

	but this guy only has a hint of lanyard underneath a beer shirt
	and I fear that we're starting to hide our signs
	fade back into the minority 
	we've a decreased density and increased desperation
	
	I manage to receive a file through the badge
	his friend says that this is nerd sex
	"Was it good for you?" I ask

	wandering with the Chicago crew 
	as they take snap shots with their wrench
	hand cuffed and goon badged and smoking on a bench

	They show up in my dream
	hiding in a covered wagon with LED wheels
	after perpetrating various wacky hijinks
	"This year we outdid ourselves"
</pre>
<h2> Monday </h2>
<pre>
	He mistakes me for a skater rather than a SysAdmin
	from the shoes, I guess - I play along with a sigh inside
	and that's when I know the spell has faded	

	Playing "Spot the geek" 
	it gets hard at the hotel around mid-day 
	and the airport is quite challenging
	but STL is like a non-stop bossfight
	
	Discriminating questions like "I can haz 0day?"
	and the right response is something like
	"I copied you a sploit but I deleted it"
	oh, sure it's tongue in cheek mockery today
	but too many can't remember when we spelled it "elite"
	
	The armor starts to come back on
	a helmet to protect me from inane drivel
	and plates to hide my frail geek physique
	
	the guy sitting next to me offered me an Oreo bite
	and to save my life in lieu of his son's should we crash
	outside the window it looks like Cassiopeia frames the moon
	I remember thinking at some point "Fuck Kansas"
	a lively birthday party behind my head
	and flashes of lightning below
