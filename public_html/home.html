	I'm receiving an inordinate number of calls from robots asking about my walls.
	Why yes, I am the head of the household, I tell them cheerfully.
	When they ask about plaster I start to equivocate
	"probably" isn't in their lexicon.
	"Please say 'yes' 'no' or 'repeat' "
	Then I cuss 'em out and hang up.
	
	lying in intolerable heat
	over 95 degrees in the house
	reading until 11 then staring at the ceiling
	the ceiling fan casts pulsating shadows on the white walls
	when I turn off the lights it causes the constellation of cancer to blink
	
	Insurance company calls to do a survey
	rate your health from excellent, very good, fair, poor, very poor
	I think my health is very good, but I don't trust my judgment on these matters
	they ask about sleep, depression, drugs, alcohol
	some of the questions make me nervous
	and some of them make me laugh
	"Do you ever have an urge to move your legs?"
	So the girl on the phone giggles a little
	"Sorry.  I have to read what's on my screen"
