Day 784  (09/22/06)
	Friday 
	driving near dusk, orange sky
	into a canopy of black clouds
	this state (IL) is filled with soul-sucking monotony
 
	I stop for gas, a beautiful scene
	A pool of light and I am alone
	with my thoughts
	Surrounded by some broken concrete
	and miles of black fields
	I smell the season
	and the isolation
	and home
	
	I reach the lodge and wander.  
	I ask the front desk
	in broken English 
	where I'm supposed to go.
	Suspicion, they pick up the phone 
	and put it down without dialing
	as they remember my parents
	I follow the directions and knock a door
	and then wander around, knocking some more
	Slip outside and walk the perimeter
	back to the front desk
	to ask the room number. 
	They give me a map
	Knock again the first door I knocked 
	and then back out into the night.
	I find them walking out of the bar.
	We find our way back there for a round
 
Saturday (09/23/06)
	Morning, McDonalds for breakfast.
	Stealing thumbs to pay for groceries
 
	To Cliff's Insane Terrain
	for Off-roading 
	I'm half-way to a heart attack most of the time
	Cars are to Father as Computers are to me.
	We see: Mud, trees
	Mnke got stuck in a hole in the slow zone.
	We hit a tree, drive through a river
	A pack of quads swarm around
	Comments on my jacket "Photo op?"
	Watching bigger toys get stuck and out
	A guy with PacMan on his fuzzy dice
	
	Why am I constantly being pwned?
 
	To a town, a winery scouting for free samples.
	We are mud-splattered and uncouth
	I think we got some looks
	A mechanically interesting corkscrew
	Mother asks if it will help open Boone's farm.
	We egress without free samples.
	Down the street, the sign says
	"We remember April 20, 2004"
	Around the corner to the monument to those killed 
	in the basement of the bar.
	"Danky" Ball was one of them
	We will never forget.
	Head to the tavern.
	They fry everything that starts with P
	Pickles, Pretzels, Pork Chops
	No food for us, just beer.
	And then to the convenience store
	Looking for snacks, I decide to instate
	"forties with the folks"
	Excited, you can't get these in St. Louis
	I put five (one for each) in the basket
	the cashier asks if I am the one
	that they are talking about:
	"one can short of a six pack"
	"one quart short of a gallon"
	Stymied by my drivers license, 
	She asks if that is Missouri mud.
	We don't want that in here
	Mother engages in conversation with
	a neat gentleman with a Mr. Rogers t-shirt.
	We didn't take the 
	Free bananas that are labeled as cucumbers.
	
	I decided to eat a piece of mud.
	
	Hanging out in the room drinking our forties. 
	When they are dead we head out
	looking for the band on the Patio 
	Somebody in formal wear, taking photos. 
	"Pretend to be Normal"
	Shhhh, Shhhhh
	No band on account of the rain
	Wedding party we wander through
	to the bar for bar activity
	While looking for a drink for Mother
	he shows us the bottle of
	Scorpion was spelled Scorpian on the LED board
	Bartender says I was the first to mention it
	I just wanted to make sure I knew how to spell it.
	Wedding guests on a scavenger hunt take photos
	They need marshmallows
	We wander to the cafe
	And acquire half a bag from the ladies behind the counter
	Find some wedding people and set one on fire for them with a lighter
	The night starts to get blurry for me.
	Parents and I end up by the pool, hot tub, sauna
	Then to sleep
 
Sunday (09/24/06)
	We learn that Mnke crashed the wedding party
	acquired some free drinks from new friends
	people trying to set him up with nieces
	and also some disapproving looks

	"That [a goatee half-light, half-dark]
	is what happens when you get hit with a shoe box 
	full of wrenches"
	 
	Walking through the wood carver festival.
	Breakfast in a former house
	The trolley bus honks at us
	since the parents stopped so Mother
	could talk to former SIU classmate
	Mnke hits the road
	We wander a trail
	
	The fun that pulls the face tight
	and shakes the strength from the limbs
	I'm asleep around seven.	
	
Day 792  (10/04/06)	
	Saturday
	weekend of Columbus Day
	Parents came down friday night
	I make eggs for breakfast
	we drive. south, past civilization
	find a river walk, a small sandy beach
	throwing pineapple shaped stickies
	abandoned cars, assorted debris
	we each pitch a brick
	concrete at the dead end
	smelling fumes from paint factory 
	back and to a bridge and down 
	playing with the frogs and clams
	poking pseudo pods with sticks, faux beaks
	under the bridge to some grass and a dock
	watching frantic fish flop out of the water
	white and blue herons and turtles sitting on logs
	pavilion reserved for a party by another Dave
	who never shows up
	pursuing lunch
	walk out of Uncle Bills
	and drive to Bahama Breeze
	Thyme tree in the mashed potato
	some shopping for youngest brother
	his birthday on Monday
	Faust Park to lie in the grass
	wander through the herbs
	looking for labels
	to the park with lakes
	to find the snakes
	we find a clam instead
	move a stick out of his way
	watch him move a laborious few inches
	spot a turtle from the bridge
	then the Chinese moon festival
	we've been talking about all day
	to eat moon cake
	and dance with Ding
	Xiaowen shows up with Ed et al
	they look at us 
	and laugh
	but it's good fun
	catch a cricket in the basement
	examine his medieval weaponry
	and pill bug armor
	
	Sunday 
	another Cold morning
	that warms as the sun rises
	to ole St. Charles 
	sit by the river 
	stuck by burrs
	wander the brick street
	try for thrift stores
	not open
	to the city
	through a ghetto
	Mustang, top down
	looking for Schafly 
	free samples of beer
	visit the TapRoom
	eating Rarebit &amp;c
	then to the brewery
	they sent the tour guide home
	just before we arrived
	we buy some shirts
	head back home
	
Day 800  (10/16/06)
	I could take pictures to save the sights
	but what could I do to help me remember
	the perfect way that the night air smells.
	autumn's leaves and lingering summer's warmth
	outside stumbling, I hear sirens
	the crunching of leaves beneath my feet
	I fall into the grass, a stable state.  
	staring at the sky.
	it's blue, it's grey, it's red, it's black.
	run back inside.
	to the beeping of microwaved egg rolls.
	I wish I could capture it.
	I want to at least experience it correctly.
	This basement.  I've seen it before.
	I want to live, goddamnit.

	the joy is fierce, almost orgasmic
	I feel like a beautiful corpse, move like a zombie
	I smile like a madman, a man possessed
	the world is still.  I am the only thing that moves
	it is a devil's playground

Day 810 (10/30/06)
	warmer outside than it is in my house
	off I go to castlewood
	walking at the base of my mountain
	straining to listen
	each rustling is an eargam
	words repeat themselves in my head 
	until I write and release them
	
	sitting on my favorite bench I see a little snake
	~6inches long, yellow band at the neck
	
	words become one and fail me
	I love the color of the leaves
	but the water is what my eye most fancies
	shrill laughter from across the river
	the quiet is what I most like listening to
	
	the soft breeze is coquettish
	in one ear whispers warm sunlight 
	and in the other of winter's approach
	
	I feel joy so overwhelming it makes me want to weep
	a smile so large it crushes me beneath its weight
	these moments are perfect, but they cannot last
	Monday is approaching 
	
	I sit and stare, try to clear my head
	people walk by while I wait
	"she walked right past it. 
	She smoked it. Woo!"
	"Huh?"
	"She smoked the bench."
	
	a craving for a lemon wedge
	I think to myself "Now, that's luxury"
	it is part of the serving suggestion 
	for my tuna-based lunch-to-go
	
	in the parking lot on the way out.
	a man, who drives a convertible
	is on a cell phone
	coordinating a hospital visit
	"we'll celebrate the cupcakes there"
	
	a driver on Manchester road
	He called me "Chief" I think
	told me my back tire was wobbling
	that it was an expensive tire and 
	I should go to the tire store.
	So I nurse it to my driveway.
	I've been hearing clicking for weeks
	thought it was my front left u-joint
	but it turns out back left lost two lug nuts
	I pretend I'm a man: jack it up
	swap the spare and properly attach it
	this should make my commute less stressful
	
	Opening the garage door I find
	a web across it and this beast 
	sitting there waiting for me
	wants to eat my Jeep, I think

Day 835  (4/23/07)	
	Saturday. I sneak off to work upon waking
	then to the bank to cash some bonds
	I still feel strange in leather jacket
	home is a shell that I am avoiding
	reading on the deck my neighbor raking behind me.
	We've never exchanged a word
	Motorcycle, Castle Wood. The day has warmed.
	bare feet on sharp rocks
	focus on the pain distracts me from
	I pause and reflect on the bench near the edge of the cliff
	five hawks circling overhead
	the hunter birds have always held a special place in my heart
	I say nothing and saying it brings such profound joy
	to say it so clearly to the people walking past me
	I try out a knowing smile that says 'yes, I am human too'
	but this is all that we have in common
	moving on.
	I start to wonder why I am so enamored of this path.
	descending, then back up. as I recrest it hits me.
	the view opens up, unblocked by trees
	river, woods, a glade
	sitting on a smooth table rock
	long trains pass by, one full of coal
	a little brown lizard runs across my fingertips

Day 844  (05/04/07)
	Saturday
	woke, cleaned the house, mowed the lawn
	I think about my schedule in terms of RFC language
	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt
	MUST go to work, pay bills, eat, sleep
	SHOULD do maintenance, chores
	MAY just relax

	I head to the moto festival at my father's suggestion
	beast is still getting squirrelly when it heats up
	navigating the city, traffic and barricades
	park. Audi's alarm squawks behind me
	the band plays "Born to be Wild"
	I sit on the curb and ponder
	I think I'm illegally parked (no change for the meter)
	but no more so than that chap in front of the hydrant
	so I wander around a while, the corner
	too many people, I don't fit in very well
	escape
	
	wind blowing hard, I feel like a waif

	to Creve Coeur, the path around the lake
	takes a while of looking before my eyes register what they see
	and they keep turning back on me
	seep off the rest of my mind's hum
	before I find myself in the moment
	Now it's quiet and I quit being so self-centered
	see myself over my shoulder, part of the scene
	sitting on concrete by a rusty bridge
	overlooking a muddy river
	think that's a turtle. Rock-like, this one
	not too exciting. something is splashing a little
	and the bugs are out in force
	follow some fish
	a lot of traffic. bikes, rollerbladers race
	yellow lane down the middle of pavement
	walk, to the gravel where sign says they aren't allowed
	has a very different feel to it
	rock, wood, canopy forms a tunnel
	the realization that I'm alone hits me.
	nervous at first. dizzy, disoriented. where did they go?
	and I'm free to, without a word, smile and turn around
	to sit on a bench and be pensive
	the scene is solid, shaded green. peaceful
	then walking, reach the path and there's people again
	road comes into view and more people still
	trying not to worry, I have nothing to worry about
	but it takes monumental effort to just. be. happy.

	in bed, reading Wordsworth out loud 'til my voice tires
	then the words come fast and silent until I turn out the lights
	blue darkness, 11:40 pm in big red numbers on the alarm clock
	face to window, bright moonlight filtered through the pine tree
	the scene is so surreal; is it mist or a cloudy window?
	a feral creature emerges from the patch of tall grass
	I follow him around the corner, and I'm at the kitchen table
	the raccoon stares at me from the deck. 
	I sit and confused... half-conscious why am I still awake?
	the world is still and quiet, windows open, wind blowing
	putz around and stare at stuff, then back to bed\
	
Day 962  (05/30/07)
	memorial day, parents come down
	I wake up on the futon early saturday to some noise and grandpa cabbage patch lurking ominous
	we drive to Herrin. Italian festa in small town, IL
	I run security detail, protecting my father from the flap of flags lining the street
	spiderman ran out of web
	
	parade. ma making fun of Miss Herrin
	throws like a girl and has flabby arms
	I'm flabbergasted.
	
	night-time concert with the pop-tart monkeys
	(too many pop jocks)
	the cops come by to break up me and my brother
	"have they never seen dancing?" I ask
	just a little harmless moshing
	we're using sign language
	they refer to the nineties as old school
	"does anyone remember Nirvana?"
	odd, considering they opened with jailhouse rock.

	Sunday. picnic then winery.
	We came for the band, find out it's a bunch of hippies.
	disappointing.
	the painting on the table is freaking out ma
	why is she laying on potato skins? (i think they might be fairy wings)
	those don't look like grapes
	is that a noodle?

	we head to the next place, a little bit friendlier
	that fish is wearing a t-shirt
	it starts to storm
	
	to the pirate movie.
	popcorn lands in my lap. puzzling.
	and then I notice the kid with the bucket on his head, eye holes poked out
	like a cardboard magneto
	whispers at me, waves
	
Day 975  (06/18/07)
	walking along the path, I take a tangent
	sitting on the bank of the Meremec
	two people fishing. What do people think about?
	I guess they think about fishing
	"Dad. Another bass, bigger"
	sweat beads and rolls tickling my tummy
	guy in a boat waves.
	after he passes his wake laps the shore
	cloud cover recolors the water
	
	it's a beautiful place I've found 
	where a tributary meets the river
	a bridge with a train sitting on it
	and water shimmers over rocks
	a crowd is on the beach nearby 
	the train shudders and clangs to life. screeching.
	
	I walk along a felled tree chasing a little brown lizard
	he pauses and bobs his head
	
	I'm standing in the river. alone.
	remembering days when I wasn't 
	It's simply beautiful.
	down stream steep high bank.
	exposed dirt white and red and bright
	up stream low flat banks dark lush green
	the water's pretty warm
	I cherish the quiet, relaxed silence
	a chance to recollect
	to sit and wait for thoughts to come
	or to breath and just breath without thoughts
	to live at my own pace
	splashes of...
	a little bird bathing
	a few fish jumping
	a family lays down a towel to the left
	
	I go home and lay waste to the rest of the day
	and I wash my face at the end of it

Day 982  (6/27/07)
	little brown spiders in my house building webs
	wispy and weak ones
	a pile of tiny bug corpses
	beneath the binary clock
	so little, so cute
	a bigger black spider is dangling in the bathroom
	I smack him with the sword/cane
	a leg is still stuck to the ceiling

	If I but sit here and wait
	sit here and wait
	what will come to me?
	Monday will come
	and hunger will come
	and thoughts fantastical
	the rain will fall
	the wind's whisper
	the thunder claps
	and bird's song
	I am fixed, immobile
	but a hub of activity as I atrophy
	oh how sore my back becomes
	and gaunt the face
	while time takes what I begrudgingly give
	the first dark spots of a new rain catch my eye
	plop, plop. sporadic and slow. crescendo
	and when the sky is water all over
	a smile creep-crosses my face and sit-waits
	the wind picks up and under the eave I become bespeckled
	watching water slowly reclaim the warped wooden deck
	that water slowly grew

Day 1000  (07/22/07)
	up til 4am playing Civ IV
	to the park to runoff stress
	grass is grown large and comical, 
	blades of exceeding character on thin stalks
	sitting on the bench reading, poem reminds me of 300
	man walks from the rock path to wood chips at my feet
	motions with his finger to indicate he's walking around in front
	"I have to do my ritual" he says and heads back the way he came
	
	buzz of cicadas, such a noisome creature
	a fly on my clipboard rubbing legs together
	the front pair, the back
	he turns to watch another bug do a flyby
	I wonder if he can rub his middle two together
	but writing this made him fly away
	
Day 1020  (08/20/07)	
	stymied by construction on the way to forest park.
	a road that no longer goes where I want
	instead a trip to world bird sanctuary
	lone elk park.
	
	bald eagles, owls, falcons
	some snakes in the visitor center
	a cute little screechy thing (American Kestrel)
	next to a peregrine falcon. beautiful
	overlooking a common chicken.
	a white necked raven between it and I
	trying to escape, eating its rope.
	keep going, little buddy.
	so sad to see these majestic creatures robbed of the sky
	a man carrying an eagle, only 3 years, brown (not yet bald)
	expels a stream of poop (I told you he wasn't house trained)
	I'm sitting by the fountain (keep off rocks)
	trying to figure out what to do. organizing my list
	reading, writing, recreation, research, and the rest
	
	down the trail, is that a sleek blue skink?
	I poke at the log he hid under
	A deer crosses the gravel
	I sit on the bench
	and wait
	
	back at home
	what looked like an unfamiliar mole
	on my inner thigh
	turned out instead to be a tick
	cheeky little thing
	I crush it with my fingernail

Day 1034  (09/07/07)
	Friday night we're rolling in the Jeep 
	blood moon low on the horizon
	what is that? he asks me
	now bright in the sky
	reflecting white on the water
	I'm dozing.  in and out of consciousness
	is that Vanilla Ice on the radio?
	in and out.  now AudioSlave.
	arrive home around three am
	treated to the glow in the dark zombies
	Saturday at the table deciding what to do
	to Kenosha, WI.  Frank's diner
	waiter guy is playing with us
	games of innocent insults
	everything mom orders is gone already
	spamwhiches for me and Mike
	markets and museums.  scaring kids in the elevator
	artful.  bodies under the floor boards and 
	nun contemplates suicide.  fun time with the family.
	to woofstock for the bands, Radioactive Squirrels
	dogs chasing rags
	such strange indigents in this city
	the swastikas on his elbows had us worried
	but then we saw him hugging the black guy
	and "Fuck Racism" on his belly
	Sunday breakfast with Grandma
	lounging by the pool
	back to woofstock for Reggae
	Monday a walk in the park
	I poke at a big spider with a stick
	we examine some remains,
	looks like an omnivore
	I drive home in the truck

Day 1114  (12/28/07)
	driving north.  traffic is dense near St. Louis
	the fog caps the speed lower than I'd like
	and I'm missing cruise control
	as I drift towards asleep
	8 hours in the car.

	Driving back home.  Sun sets.
	Stars out over the highway.  Lately I see them so seldom
	Orion over my left shoulder, like a friend I haven't seen since school
	My back is itchy from wool sweater.  Jacket.  Trench coat.
	Playing games with the heat
	Twisting knobs and opening windows.

07/08/08
	Leaving work, Creve Coeur
	40 miles an hour.  North High School
	Now Enrolling.  Kinder Care
	Left lane must turn left
	Lane ends merge left
	City of Maryland Heights
	Do not enter
	
	270 North
	Gray clouds, cranes, trees.
	
	My child is an outstanding student
	I'd rather be sailing.
	
	An hour to get out of Saint Louis.
	Arrive at Springfield in another hour
	
	Tune to AM 530 for information on the Illinois Michigan canal
	So I do, and it sounds psychotic.
	Driving over a bridge, driving through construction
	Interspersed with and mostly overridden by weather service
	and some music faintly in the background.
	Illinois 50 percent chance of rain
	Michigan Partly cloudy
	Canal Alabama
	Visitor Center Portions of Tennessee
	Static static Michigan
	End Workzone Speed Limit
	
	Watching the sun set
	framed by stationary clouds
	purple shadows chasing the fading orange
	
	Corn, Soy Beans, Corn
	In the darkness they start to fade
	
	Another hour to get to Bloomington
	two hours to get to Rockford
	
	Illinois Cement Company has a tower that is lit at night
	some kind of cyberpunk monument in the middle of farmland
	
	Near Rockford I'm following a goat sticker labeled USBGA
	I thought it was billy goat, but I later learn it's Boer Goat
	down the US Grant Memorial Highway
	reminds me of Goats for Kids
	
	Old men talking at Hardees
	with such contempt for wireless internet and computers
	a detour takes me over the Kishwaukee river
	
	From Rockford one hour remains.
	McHenry County, Lake County
	It starts to get familiar
	Fox Lake, Grand Ave
	Lehman mansion, Caboose Park
	The library that I used to walk to
	The man with the neon pretzel
	And home again
