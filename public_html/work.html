	I arrive at seven on the dot, it seems
	the door unlocks as I approach it
	a quiet 'snick' and the red light turns green
	
	flipping through my desktops
	scoffing at the email I've been writing 
	I've been writing for two weeks now
	I've got two lines down
	most of the content is apologizing for not writing sooner
	I think I'll finish it next week

	we're test driving chairs
	they gave me the deluxe model (with the checkerboard pattern)
	more levers and knobs than I know what to do with
	I removed the arms since they interfere with my vulture perch

	indoors - an artificial and stifling environment
	when you look around - it's a box
	tolerable when you're living on the other side of the screen.
	(the computron is limitless)
	the air in here feels unreal
	I think it is... the lack of breeze
	like dust collecting in the lungs
	rebreathing the same stale stuff
	I need to step outside for a moment.	
	
	Sunday
	11:15am
	It is dark.
	I am at work.
	With the lights off.
	Aiming for 80 hours this week.
	The whole building is silent and still.
	Thunder rumbles quietly in the distance.
	I usually don't wear shoes.
	I can additionally eschew socks today.
	Yesterday I wore my punk pants
	plaid and rife with safety pins.
	I don't even need to pretend to be human
	When I work on the weekend.
 
	Am I wearing my jacket?
	Did I lock myself out?
	Ah, no.  I remember
	that I'm still in the building
	sitting in my chair
	staring at the screen

	driving home the reflection on the street
	of the taillight of the truck ahead of me
	is the crown of a tulip, inspiring awe
	now a dull blur
	I reflect on the shininess of road surfaces
	I turn a corner and the car in front of me casts a streak
	now something more sinister
	
	the droplets on the windshield are out of focus
	bursts of yellow blinker, fading to red
	The beauty of it strikes me
	but then I start to dissect it
	I'm a digital boy, so jaded
	It's just some textures 
	and a few hundred lines of code, all told
	some GL_POINTS here and some blending there
	in my machine just a few tweaks will twist it
	We are the dreamers that can make any dream real
