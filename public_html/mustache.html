	I glued on a pencil thin mustache this morning
	trying to make it not look like Hitler's
	with my Charlie Chaplain tie
	but Mr. Potato heads goatee isn't that big
	and that's all the felt I could find
	I ripped off my mustache in the car
	the fumes of the super glue were starting to get to me
	(my sinuses were rather sore to begin with)
	and though the "Craft Scent" was rather pleasant
	it left me feeling a little bit poisoned
	I find myself unable to persevere
	and so I gave up on love
	love of Mustache May
