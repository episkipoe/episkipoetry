<h1> DefCon14 </h1>

<h2> Wednesday </h2>
<pre>
	St. Louis, airport.  Waiting to board.  
	A blond heading home sits between me and a man.
	mentions something sounding like a strip search, stops short
	the man conjures camaraderie with me.  
	says we want to hear more.
	humidity and hair
	compliments and conversation
	business or pleasure, my line of work: computers
	he tells me that common people (not that I'm not one) 
	don't think about these sorts of things
	
	Arrival.
	I spot a hacker on the tram.  
	We exchange a greeting 
	Do we own the city already? 
	This should be fun...
	
	dinner at in&amp;out burger, pick up supplies, 
	walk the strip, 
	most amused by a midget with a microphone at Doublin' Up
	scout the Riviera
	the devil is pouring drinks
	
	We are asked "Do you speak English?"
	Then she borrows my friend's cell phone.
	
	A well-dressed woman asking for money
	is agitated by my ambivalence.
</pre>
<h2> Thursday ("pre-con") </h2>
<pre>
	registered, walked around, going free agent.
	Trapped in perimeter.  
	Pacing, bounded by an invisible fence
	afraid to leave, afraid to integrate.
	I feel like I recognize these people.
	But like me they are insular.
	Coagulated into cliques.
	Presenting a high barrier to entry.
	
	Toxic BBQ launch area.
	Crowd reaching critical mass, I'm shedding the shell.
	Sit by a laptop, friendly faces. 
	Meet Cenobyte and Cygnus.  Canadians.
	Then through them H20 and SnowMan.  Brothers from Bronx.
	
	Taxi to the Wynn for fancy cars, walk to TI for the show.
	H20 is giving us lessons in confidence.
	Pictures of pretty ladies with Cygnus.
	Walking back to the Riviera.  
	It is night.
	
	Someone gave me a parachuting ninja.
	"It's okay, it won't hurt you."

	I don't have a hotel room
	so I borrow some floor space
</pre>
<h2> Friday (it begins) </h2>
<pre>
	Breakfast at the Pepper Mill
	Late start due to inspection.  
	Fierce crowding and confusion.
	iPod boom box plays our soundtrack
	I feel cooler than I should be allowed to

	First talk:  atlas script kiddie to hacker
	net cat is your friend
	
	another talk
	harmony of multiple personalities
	madness to go half-way

	spend the day in sessions, wandering.
	I find Elonka, follow her to the cafe

	hard drive forensics
	Nathan comes to check on me
	tail end of a Johnny Long talk

	a talk on bioinformatics (my core interest)
	I was hit by a beach ball 

	the sun has set, night takes over
	by the pool security tap on SnowMan shoulder, 
	requests the music off.
	he asks for respect
	some jocks attempt to escalate, 
	speculating upon our gathering
	a number of security disperse those evil hackers
	We're being followed
	duck into the end of hiding data in file system
	
	tcp/ip drinking game
	these are the men that get things done
	awe and reverence and laughter 
	head to the skybox on rumors of strippers
	moose gets us into hacker pimps.
	life's transience is here in ink saviored
	
	a man, visibly intoxicated,
	attempts to inform me of a party at...
	the end of the conversation 
	he seems to have forgotten that it began.

	heading to the Hilton 
	I break off from (a growing) congregation
	(for my fear of grass)
	
	back to the (quieting) box.
	I am a mortal that has stumbled on to mount Olympus
	everywhere I turn I can see a god.
	I hear the story of a little Jewish boy in a catholic school.
	his first communion: "Thanks for the cookie"
	(I never expected to see nerds with doey-eyed groupies)
	
	I wander: surreal, as if in a dream.
	Follow someone following a goon
	Wind up in the penthouse
	I'm not cool enough for the black ball
	Find Cenobyte and Cygnus up there
	The Bronx boys arrive and I follow them out
	
	to a different Hilton building for a shmoo con party.
	Fish saw Madonna on a tootsie roll inside a bible.
	pouring miraculous drinks.
	spiritus sancti, beautiful blasphemy
	he whispers to me 'there is no god'
	We leave as they start to make waffles.
	
	Back to the Pepper Mill 
	to a glut of beautiful women.
	watching H20 operate
	
	The sun is rising
	Walking another first-timer back to the Sahara
	I catch a few hours of sleep
	Sizable blister on left foot
</pre>
<h2> Saturday </h2>
<pre>
	never been so happy to have 
	my synapses firing as erratically
	there is nothing like a crowd to make me feel alone
	but in the midst of Def Con I have found a second home
	
	EFF dunk tank.  An entertaining representative
	in a Microsoft shirt, singing its praises
	mocking the penguin boys.
		
	Visual log analysis beauty of graphs
	log analysis and correlation

	hacking unix with FreeBSD jail(8)
	layers of complexity
	in India they love rats, in NYC they don't

	hunting for metamorphic engines
	liken viruses to genetic diversity 
	interesting overlap with bioinformatics talk

	Hacker Jeopardy most amusing.
	A drunk wants to exchange badges as a sign of friendship
	almost an altercation, but they pull him off of me
	
	leave the room, see a crew struggling in the hallway with old hardware. 
	A prize, a relic
	They keep dropping it, so I help them carry it.
	They let me in the room, give me a sticker
	keep asking who I am.
	And I never know quite how to answer that.
	Am I a demigod or just a simple daemon?
	
	I'm drinking SoCo &amp; Red Bull in a former water bottle.
	They insist that I'm drinking my own urine.
	I offer them some.  Strangely, they decline.
	We head out into the street.
	An interesting chat with cops.
	Literally asking to be arrested (really, but not really, you know)
	He sniks out his baton and pretends to assault for a photo op.
	The cops here are pretty cool, I guess
	
	Solar powered personas find fuel in neverending nights
	guardians of requisite sanity gain wrinkles from worry
	
	life, it bleeds in all directions 
	hear the peace that permeates 
	achieve stealthy stability
	try not to worry, sweet children, try not to cry
	try to turn a blind eye to these travesties that accrue
	an angel checking ids, but the devil didn't have to
	this david cares not to
	let the light last, and the confusion reign
	
	The Wynn was wild, a drink over the edge
	gut damn these women if they couldn't stop a heart
	
	I reach the point where words fail.  
	The language center is soaked, the periphery only doused
	And so I communicate with Spanish and sign language.
	Neither of which I really know that well.
	I think the surrogate crew knows ASL, 
	they made me stop for fear of ghosts

	One is gambling: craps at circus, circus.
	I remember not-hearing a comment 
	that sparked some controversy
	an underage kid denied entrance
	I think I promised to see his talk tomorrow
	consent by 'too confused to argue'
	I'm entranced by the wise red hat giving him a life-lesson
	he talks like a stream both calm and fast
	
	I find myself back in the hotel.
	Alone.  I must have surreptitiously escaped their company.
	
	Sitting, writing.
	a few drunken conversations with strangers
	one informs me that there might be hackers in this building.  
	wink, wink
	
	Hotel staff made me move, made me hide from fear of dominoes
	(afraid those bastards will steal electricity if they see me operate a pen)
	but the dominoes have hit the floor, the power is held captive in batteries
	and is being made to perform unspeakable calculations
	
	So I move upstairs and kneel at a table in the hallway and continue to write.
	I am seen.
	Hackers move me to a couch
	in darkness.
		
	Looks like I've made it, accidentally, to what they call a "party"
	exhilaration, exuberance.  the liberation of libation
	as I attempt to explain that I am nobody 
	and that I am Dave to souls that mostly understand
	but will never, can never remember.
	
	like that state of living that is pure
	my state of identity, belonging, is fleeting
	the ink flows in beautiful patterns, music moves my hand
	manifest to an unwilling, unknowing mind
	shadows of form swaying in my periphery
	constitute the only other part of my existence
	
	they lament my killing of trees
	brain cells are the prey du jour
	what can we glean from these minds focused on debauchery
	one of more mettle than I would integrate
	one with more edge would prowl
	I am a dagger among swords 
	
	I can't compete with this noise so I withdraw
	asking for too much food in too little a mouth
	but I love this energy, this beat, this feeling
	where else can we find salad days for the mentally inclined?
		
	words are my medium.  except in them I do not exist.
	and they are (each, alone) mundane.
	in sequences they can be (but rarely) brilliant
	illuminating.
	
	I am face down, furniture.
	But it is a forcibly social environment.
	Conversation ensues.
	Incoherent connections.  I now know I am not alone.
	I could live forever between these words.
</pre>
<h2> Sunday </h2>
<pre>
	A daze.  My brain has failed to cycle after the last power down.
	I failed to attend two talks I wanted to see.
	don't have a change of clothes with me
	So I jump in a shower with my shorts on.
	
	Sitting at a table with a man with blue hair.  
	I am introduced to the term "rollin' balls"
	as his excuse for not really remembering we met last night
	He's playing World of Warcraft.
	Small talk, system administration
	He touches my knee and continues to hit on me.
		
	Come evening I again hook up with my core four.
	Tropicana in a limo looking for a Cuban restaurant.
	Eat Italian instead, coffee perks me up.
	learn about Sleep, Time management, Study skills	
	Talking physics with the local girl that H20 found.
</pre>	
<h2> Monday </h2>
<pre>
	Con over, back to being a freak
	called my host on a stranger's cell phone for no answer
	I'm not there for his call back, but I hear that I was abducted by ninjas.
	
	Shrink Wrap
	We must be humble, we must be plastic.
	But bullshit sounds sweeter than truth when it slides through sly lips
	We must be vigilant and know what is axiomatic.
	Building immense towers by stacking grains of sands.
	A rush, a thrill.  Akin to panic.   To get it all done today.
