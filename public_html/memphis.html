	the air smells of fresh rain
	hundreds of dead worms
	through the parking lot
	now near the building
	cigarette smoke and hamburgers
	
	Its Easter and Spring Break for the Folks
	They drive down to escape the snow
	another foot is coming in their never-ending winter
	
	I take them to Crazy Bowls & Wraps
	In the car she asks "Is this Phantom of the Opera?" as the organ sounds.  
	"Oh, it's just his crazy radio station"
	
	Driving through cow country
	on the way to Sikestown
	where they throw rolls
	on the way to Graceland, Memphis
	listening to Elvis
	
	Mom has lost her feet (seriously I can't find them)
	in the back seat of the Mustang
	(have you seen my feet?)
	then she drops an M&M in her shoe
	[your foot would have stopped it]
	
	The sticker at Sun Records says "I'm not here"
	the whole thing has an other-worldly feel
	it's the birthplace of rock&roll they say.  Mecca
	but Graceland has too many gift shops to feel sacred
	inundated with his face on merchandise
	there's more purchase than pilgrimage about you...
	
	I explain how we gave Mr. Infinity (the Microsoft superhero) a taco.
	
	Night time and we're on Beale street
	looking for BBQ - just talking to people
	BBKing and some blues music
	Watching people in the street
	cops keep showing up
	they seem to just be moving barricades
	(I need some backup to move this another foot)
	and their cars around
	just abandoning them with lights flashing
	
	I took the Shoe Mitt from the hotel.  Like I said I would.
	It's just fun to say.  And the moisturizer
	and the matches that say "For Fire Use Only"
	Ryan took a pack, too.
	Falling asleep to the Chapelle show
	we're awakened by some preacher
	Ma knocks on the door and turns on the princess bride
	
	The riverside statue.  Is he rescuing a guy or is that a fish?
	I think he's rescuing the fish.  Impaled on his obelisk.
	Coast guard floats down the river.  What the hell are they guarding?
	[Don't want them Arkansas boys sneaking over here]
	
	I set off the alarm when my hand brushes the foot of BB King
	the lady attending the desk at the Information Berk is captivating
	Marking up our map with lines and Xs, just a hint of sass
	but I can't help but stare at her tired blue veins
	
	We drive down the street called "General Washburn's Escape Alley"
	at the end we find three bricks and a shoe.
	
	I did enjoy Sun Records, the guide had some personality
	and we learn more about shy Elvis and his early failures
	
	White rock is exposed, grey clouds curling over
	in muted tones of dark drown the branches sweep
	and baby buds the size of rain drops on the windshield
	whisper of spring's desire and there's a blue heron standing in the ditch
	
	I'm writing in the car while Ryan drives, listening to Bad Religion
	Reading in-between.  Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
	Halfway between this world and the NeXT
	[I am a man, part machine, born of circuit stock
	my pulse is measured in megahertz
	synapse sparks keyboard hand
	gathering digital daisies
	under a silicon sun...]
	
	The Meremac is flooded.  It's washed away houses
	fields are flooded, sheets of water shimmering
	a hint, a dream, of untold depths
	
	with big flakes of snow falling I have to find an alternative route home
	It is incredibly beautiful in the transitory sense
	life is hardly ever like this

	
	Parents stop by on the way back north
	we go to a grocery store for land shark
	neither mom nor I are wearing our glasses
	and so we're waving a beer triumphantly
	at a stranger on the other side
	that looked vaguely like Dad
