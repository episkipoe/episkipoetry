	I put a post-it stating
	"I am a banana"
	on a banana
	the banana is gone now.
	someone has written on the post-it
	"the one who is watching me is a monkey"
	today I put it on an apple
	I like to think of it as an "apple with aspirations"

	on the way home 
	Stop at Dierbergs for Guinness&amp;sushi
	the Bagger (Audrey) imp-like 
	beautiful green eyes and a wide grin
	notices my hat, asks what that is.
	A fish hook. I remove my hat and show her
	some people comment on danger, but she approves
	she notices the "devil spikes" on top
	says they are cute
	asks what my shirt says
	"This is a good Friday"
	her son plays the kettle drum at Bahama Breeze
	They are from Tobago, Jamaica

	the kindly-looking cashier scans a few things
	pauses
	and asks for my ID
	I picked him out of all of those available
	since he has the most sincere smile
	a devilish grin. grey hair and sharp eyes
	reminding me of Bilbo Baggins
	and when he realizes that the bottle doesn't have alcohol in it
	(pomegranate juice, sparkling)
	he tells me a story.
	when he had been working here just a short while
	("I'll never forget it" he says)
	a kid (10, 12 years old) put a bottle on the belt
	he asked for ID (it looked like whiskey)
	the kid responds "For what? Syrup?"
	
	sunday driving, wandering on the path of least resistance
	letting traffic dictate where I go.
	avoiding lane switches, left turns
	leaving the grocery store I am disoriented. where am I?
	I sometimes fear that this shirt is too anti-social "I HATE PEOPLE"
	but it elicits another positive comment.
	"I know how you feel" says the bagger pushing carts

	it's quiet in Union Station, just before five.  trains.  mall.
	it reminds me of buying cigs in the Galleria, cloves and courting
	It's a beer place, Budweiser
	my mood runs more sour
	keeping my smile in reserve
	I'm out of place here, too.
	An interloper on the wooden bench with brass balls
	Security walks by with food in styrofoam, large coke
	kiosk girl plays solitaire
	
	I carry some dice with me
	you never know when you'll need to roll for initiative
	gambling with my grandma with a d20, d12 and d4, 
	betting my spikes against a popsicle.  
	It was delicious
