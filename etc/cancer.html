<h1>Cancer</h1>
<pre>
02/03/05
	Awakened by demons two nights (at least) in a row
	cursing.  Pain follows me, health failing.
	I've been coughing for months.
	My chest is turning blue.

03/11/05
	Going to Bloomington this weekend to hang with the folks
	To see Ryan for the first time in almost a year
	We finally got the HypnoDragon to work
	The hollow face illusion is super trippy
	Ray Jobbins says I should go to the doctor
	the professional medical opinion of a med student

3/13/05 
	My first Professional hair cut.  
	Lose the long hair.
	Kinda fun.

03/14/05
	This morning I picked up hair gel &amp; donuts. 
	At the office I have a message (from myself)
	I plan on going to the doctor tomorrow.
	But if I stop dying so fast will like taste so sweet?  Well...

03/15/05
	After work I head to the Urgent Care center
	(even though it really doesn't feel urgent)
	There is a shadow on my x-ray
	They hand me a manilla envelope and send me to the emergency room
	I ask if I can stop by my apartment first
	He asks how long I intend to delay
	Oh, maybe an hour or two
	I gots to take care of business
	He permits it with some reluctance
	It's probably not immediately life threatening
	but I really need to do something about it sooner than later

	I was afraid that it was nothing.  
	that they would brush me off and I would continue to cough
	or that it was serious and I didn't want to know
	early signs are pointing towards the latter.

	The emergency room is busy.
	Keep me waiting for a long time.  
	Getting sleepy.

	I step on the scale
	Weighing 112 pounds
	They asked me about a will.
	I don't have one.
	Do I need one?

	David.  I feel.  nervous.
	I just want to go home.
	How should I feel?

	They let me in and lie me down.
	I wait some more.
	Yellow foam, white pillow.
	Reminds me of grade school.
	Visiting the nurse's office.

	Waiting sucks, the suck of boredom
	But I may find I far prefer it to whatever Hell awaits me.
	Pray for me.

	Every so often I think:  "Why am I in a hospital?
	Who am I?  Am I insane?"

	Some psychopath collapsed one of my favorite veins 
	while trying to take blood with a turkey baster.

	I can hear a seizure down the hall.  It is howling.
	over my neck there is a warning:  
	"STAND CLEAR!  THIS DOOR MAY ROLL DOWN AT ANY TIME"

	So now it is that I know what it feels like to have doctors (2 so far) 
	tell you that you may have a large, life-threatening tumor.
	But also: they have no idea what it actually is.
	so far I've been told that it could be:
	my thyroid, fluid, a benign or malignant tumor (lymphoma)
	or something that we've never seen before
	Ah, that's what I'm hoping most for
	an alien to burst from my chest

	I'm not bulging
	So surely this tumor can't be much bigger than a baby
	I'll just think of this as a pregnancy 
	without any increase in responsibility

	I'm not looking forward to talking to my family about this

	Finnegan's wake must be played at my wake  (mosh pit NOT optional)
	whisky (water of life) will be thrown on me 
	I want to be cremated and put in film canisters
	put in jacket pockets and donated to churches, good will, salvation army, &amp;c.

	They want 3 days to review the results
	and balk at doing a biopsy right away
	she'll talk to the doctor and call back tomorrow 
	I'm tentatively scheduled for Monday at 1:20

	After all that time they tell me it's no emergency.  
	I get home a little after 3am
	Catch a few hours sleep before work.

03/16/05
	Re: my new hair
	DJ asked if I had a job interview
	Jing said I look more like a gentleman than a boy
	Tom said I look more like a businessman than a hippy

	They tell me I need to talk to a lung guy. 
	I don't like this waiting room
	There's nothing going on

03/18/05
	I feel remarkably well considering what a nightmare yesterday was
	I'm getting compliments on the new purple jacket.

03/21/05
	CT scan today
	I feel lazy, unable to concentrate (is it a sickness symptom or just nervousness)
	Putting in the IV they splash my blood, the other nurse had to stick me
	I have to pull down my pants because zipper is metal 
	Note:  wear sweat pants to future CT scans
	Taking out the IV more blood splashes
	but it's still not as bad as the ER
	I'm done by 2

	Even though you're not dying
	I want you to take this moment 
	to appreciate the things that you take for granted.
	
	This hospital stuff is more of a pain than the symptoms I had.
	A couple of cough drops and some robotrippin' I could cope
	The Barium tasted kinda citrusy.  
	Pretty good in a "watch your shoes" type of way
	Biopsy tomorrow.

03/22/05
	It's weird seeing code 9 years old that claims to be temporary
	like a septuagenarian talking about what he wants to do when he grows up

	To Lab.  For blood work.
	pricked four times this session
	My head rolls.  I almost faint.
	backup is called in.  
	I'm told my veins are easy to blow out
	other nurses tell me I have very good veins

	I feel pretty great (both despite and because of)
	being told I might die soon
	Death doesn't scare me much
	I've courted him for so long we've become friends
	the moment has a very sense of now,
	has my full attention like nothing else ever has
	I feel like I should be scared, because they expect it
	maybe they are not trying to scare me, just to make it real
	and I don't feel the right emotions
	they seem to think that I'm too happy, nonchalant
	that I must not be aware of what's going on
	A nurse that looks like Cathy Bates 
	smiling and subtly angry at my ignorance
	like she wants to shake my shoulders and say:
	"My god!  Don't you understand the gravity of the situation.
	You stupid boy, you're going to die.  So start crying"
	the word cancer is now stronger than a hint
	obliquely it becomes my diagnosis 
	and not just one possibility among many
	they tell me that I need family, I need support
	but I just want to be alone

	The biopsy is rescheduled because I need someone to drive me home.
	Ah, they're going to give me the good stuff
	Ryan should arrive tonight

03/23/05
	I arrive for my biopsy.
	They tell Ryan it will be boring for him and he can leave.
	So he does.
	Ma calls him and proceedes to chastise him for it.
	She asks the name of the Hospital.
	He says "I dunno, it's Something Jewish"
	"What, like a bagel?"
	(No, it's Barnes Jewish)

	I overhear one doctor telling another
	"I don't think any one told him he probably has cancer"
	and maybe he's right

	This is not a good experience.
	Not painful, but not much fun.
	the the drugs weren't as powerful as I had hoped
	Sure I'm still a little loopy but I could still drive myself home
	they made me wait around in an oncologist's office for over an hour 
	(Ryan had time to finish a game of Risk (on his laptop)).  
	Then they told me to go home and come back the next day.
	I remember Lisa telling me I could leave
	Didn't respond much to her, just said to Ryan "let's go"
	Apparently the drugs did have some effect
	Dazed, somber, face ashen, head lolling.
	She asked if it was okay
	I said yes.
	(I lied)
	
	Sitting in the basement
	Ryan on the phone with Mom 
	he doesn't have many details
	I snatch the phone away
	(drug impaired judgment)
	I drop the word cancer as casually as I can.
	I'm more worried about her than I am about me
	she seems to take it seriously
	Freaks out, heads out the door 
	starts the 6 hour trip to my apartment.
	I feel badly for the inconvenience.
	Then I feel good to have them near.
	
03/24/05
	I have a message waiting (&amp; new post-its on my desk)
	Parcinski's office starts out: "this is a message for David"
	(since my voice mail greeting still says I'm Chad)

	we're waiting a while at Pluard's office.
	a nurse pokes out her head and says:
	"It won't be long for David now"
	we have a good laugh at that
	it's the worst thing you could say

	The doctor explains it like this.  When I was very little.  My testicles, apparently, were in my forehead.  This is, of course, normal and nothing to worry about.  When you are just one cell big, pretty much your entire being is your forehead.

	Anyway, on their way to my groin some rebel faction decided to take a left at my lungs.  This might explain why I've never been much in the balls department.  But that's another story.

	In some inappropriate display of machismo, the testicle in my lung has grown to about the size of a hand grenade.  My new theme song is sung by ACDC: "I've got the biggest balls of them all."  

	We're still waiting for the final results of the biopsy.  Originally, his best guess was Lymphoma.  Now, it's Seminoma type Germ Cell (aka testicular).  

	The doctor says if it was Lymphoma this size I should feel really sick.  Since I feel really good, it seems that it's just a pathetic excuse for cancer.  Whose ass I should be able to readily kick with some chemo.

	They later told me that my veins blow out easy.  For one set of tests they had to poke four times to fill their little vials.  They've been taking blood just about every day this week and I've had two IVs so far.  I've got track marks to make any trainspotter jealous.  My right arm feels like a cat's belly with all them nipples.  

	we're still not certain.
	wait for the biopsy results 
	may take a few days
	
	I am glad my parents are here
	Thanks for the support
	but I want to believe that I'm strong enough not to need it
	
	of all the things that should've given me cough or cancer...
	I've smoked just about anything I could fit in a pipe
	slugs, vicodin, flintstones vitamins, osiris root, wormwood, etc
	of all the things to kill me...  I've lived an unhealthy life
	arbitrary fasts and binges, lack of exercise, etc
	I can't believe the gall of my balls...

03/25/05
	Convienently, I had previously requested today off.  For Easter.
	I was going to go home.  Lake Villa.
	Instead I have a PET scan.
	They're gonna shoot me up with some radioactive sugar
	and light that sucker up like a Christmas tree.  

	Father drives us to St. Louis 
	navigate the building they call "Big Barnes"
	they make me wear paper pants and lie still for so long

	After the procedure they tell me to drink fluid
	so that I urinate out the radiation
	so we have beer with Imo's pizza

	Results arrive over the weekend.
	It's the "Best case scenario"
	the right cancer and it hasn't spread

03/28/05
	First day of chemo
	two stabs to get the IV in
	hopefully this rig will last at least a few days
	the two people who will be here 6 hours with me:
	Dave to the left, then Matt (non-seminoma about my age)
	They're napping.
	two older gentlemen to my right.
	already starting to feel heavy, headache
	Bleomycin on Tuesdays.  this is going to be a rough ride
	injections of saline give mouth taste of hospital
	some kids came in and gave out cups full of sweets 
	cause he has communion coming up
	Nice, but weird, to be a legitimate target of charity
	(reminding me of the time the lady from the library gave me food
	because she thought I was homeless.  
	I was walking home with my pockets stuffed with DVDs)

	After treatment I go to work for a little while

03/30/05
	A woman is impressed just learning that I'm a software engineer
	I find it odd, since she doesn't know if I'm actually any good at it
	After all, programming ain't brain surgery
	
	A nurse tells me her husband is Cisco certified.
	She enjoys surfing the web.
	I tell her about my father constantly checking the weather.
	she says her husband watches the weather channel
	in a tone which makes it sound like an absurd thing to do
	I admit I don't understand the appeal of it.

	We sit and snooze
	amuse ourselves with minor activities
	Sometimes people come in for a short session
	and then leave us long-timers behind
	but it is a small room and quiet
	across the hall is a noisier room where 
	women sit and chat

	It is a peaceful place
	the head lolls about
	there is nothing to worry about
	no responsibility
	just sit and watch the fluid drip
	6 hours of drip.  drip.  drip.
	It's mostly water
	I gain water weight
	cannot sleep at night
	since I need to urinate very often
	so I am especially sleepy during the day
	it works out.  Watching the drip.
	Soporrific, sweet quiet drip.  drip.  drip.

03/31/05
	I like the lady at the front desk of the Hospital
	she tells me "We have to stop meeting like this"
	wears a cross working at a Jewish hospital

04/01/05
	I don't go to work at all today.
	It's been a long week of chemo.
	There was a Harley party that I didn't attend.
	For the next two weeks I only have treatments on Tuesdays.
	And only for an hour or so.

04/04/05
	At work I called Switzerland today.
	Food is starting to taste like metal to me.
	(They warned me about this.  Said it may kill my appetite.)
	Strangely, this seems to increase my desire to eat.
	I think I might be a robot.

04/05/05
	Grandma Bennett died yesterday.  Of cancer.
	What a period in my life this is.
	I feel so distant from myself, but so connected.
	More appreciative of what I have and nearly immune to strife.

	DJ ribbed me a little, saying my mohawk wasn't extreme enough
	told me to dye it before I cut it

04/06/05
	I ate a lunchable today.  It was pretty good.
	Capri sun tastes like field trip.

04/11/05
	Hair started falling out today
	I pull it out by clumps
	wxw gave me food
	wontons

	Every so often it used to hit me.
	The immensity of it.
	And now it's lost it's impact
	it's only an inconvenience, 
	not a real threat

04/18/05
	Very busy today
	KC &amp; N8 left around 10:30
	My usual room is full
	so we start off in the women's room
	they tell us we look like high school students
	it's the second time I'm told that I'm too young
	get it in on the 3rd try today - not good, but hopefully it will stick
	2 pokes from Dory, the final from Mary (whose hair reminds me of a vector)

	nervous when a nurse says to me
	"Did you have a scan done?
	How do I say this?  He found that you had a ... very ... uh,"
	Relief at the next two words:  "good response"
	my x-ray looks about normal, he says
	wants a CT scan before next Monday

	the one I thought was Lisa is actually named Carrie

	The zombie survival guide my mother gave me could just as well be a guide
	teaching zombies how to survive

	A young boyfriend brought flowers to a girlfriend in treatment.  
	There's an older couple here as well.
	Then I move to the men's ward.
	Looks like Matt is done.
	Good for him.

04/19/05
	A lady here is on her 5th or 6th shot today
	talk about no veins left
	Doyle to the left of me, 
	Says they get it first time, every time
	Even with chemo, they gave him 6 months to live
	He's not much older than I am.
	He's giving up, want to stop treatment.
	But still sounds upbeat, pragmatic, kinda defiant.
	Nurse says "No, don't do that"
	She sounds emotionally sincere, but more distant than compelling.

	Ding shaved his head in solidarity.  Cool.
	Mom should show up today.
	Yesterday was flunk day.
	I skipped work, 
	wish I could have skipped treatment
	(and started drinking at 5am)

04/22/05
	my mother dresses me up like medusa, plastic snakes on my head
	like uncle fester, a lightbulb in my mouth
<img src="images/medusa.JPG" width=300 height=400>
<img src="images/uncle fester.JPG" width=400 height=300>
	
05/06/05
	Hoped to go home for Mother's day
	but I stayed here and slept instead

05/12/05
	I like to listen to the older gentlemen
	one wants to suck on the alcohol foam
	we're told there are no explicit rules against alcohol, but it's BYOB
	comment about protecting my "young ears"
	"his mother won't let him come in any more"

05/13/05
	Grandma Reynolds is visiting
	A doctor has a birthday, my mom brings party hats
<img src="images/chemo - grandma visit0.jpg" width=400 height=300>

05/18/05
	Computer froze 12 times
	replacement is on the way
	it anticipates its destruction

05/20/05
	New machines arrives
	spent the day configuring it

05/24/05
	I take the day off work to celebrate my last treatment
	and I feel quite ill.

05/27/05
	apparently I made quite a stir over at Wash U
	they had radiologists and pulminologists, etc. looking at my charts
	quite impressive, my recovery

05/30/05
	Memorial Day 
	parents brought my bike down.
	Kawasaki Vulcan 750

06/06/05
	Day off: another round of chemo
	on account of too much fluid in my lungs

06/08/05
	Cancer Survivorship &amp; the Power of a Smile
	they comment that I'm wearing shoes
	I usually don't do that
	Here I learn that Dr. Pluard was a CS major
	and meet a guy that owned a Commodore 64

06/17/05
	I threw up the barium
	it was the pleasantest thing I've ever regurgitated.
	Coincidently the CT machine broke just before my turn
	So I have to reschedule anyways

06/21/05
	My real last day of treatment
	Mary says it's time for Margaritaville

06/23/05
	First day to ride motorcycle to work.

07/05/05
	I put in an offer for a home.

07/08/05
	excess fluid (hazy-orange) drained from lungs
	a procedure I could never pronounce
	the most intensely painful part of the ordeal

07/14/05
	becoming more asocial if such a thing is possible
	or maybe just accustomed to it
	think of people less as people and more as input/output vectors
	what do you give? what do you take?	
	I hope such thoughts do not adversely affect my actions
	I am still aware that cordial relations are key to happiness

07/28/05
	Hey, I'm over 127 lbs.  
	Most I've ever weighted

07/29/05
	weird.  There's a ladder in the next cube.
	All I see are feet.

08/01/05
	I miss getting injections
	Since I still have the anticipation of it
	The anticipation with no end.  

	My usual phlebotomist only the penultimate time did she see my tattoo, 
	how I kept it hidden until then I have no idea.  
	And she freaked out so completely.  
	Almost killed by a boa as a child she harbors such hatred for the serpentine.

	This morning was 98 degrees
	Closed on my house today.
	On the way back to the office.
	Clear skies.
	Now hail.  
	I drive into a wall of water.
	Large chunks of ice falling out of the sky.
	
	12:30 I'm awakened by a cop since my neighbor got his door kicked in
	Looking forward to moving out of the Apartment

08/24/05
	Cindy said I looked handsome
	It's neat getting compliments for looking almost like a normal person
	Matt has a beard.

08/31/06
	Thursday
	EKG today. 
	This is your aorta.
	Checking on my heart murmur.
	This is your left ventricle.
	I really enjoyed the user interface of the machine.
	This will be cold.
	Track ball and touch screen.

10/20/07
	by some happy coincidence I realize it's Wednesday now.
	I double then triple check my phone for date. time.
	since the microwave is now no help.
	then pull the bottle from the bag.
	and pour. and drink.
	the barium sulfate residue 
	on the side of the special paper cup 
	from Merry X-Ray Corporation
	(service is our only product)
	is like a snowy spider web of a Rorschach test
	tendril'd and reticulated
	pools and sticks in a curious splatter pattern 
	liquid thick and heavy with a certain citrus twang
	they gave me four cups. 
	I was supposed to get three.
	I wash and reuse one.
	Pack the others away, a growing collection.
	You never known when you might want 16 oz of milk
	or need exactly 300 cc of orange juice, stat.
	
	a bloody awful inconvenience of trips and traffics
	but I'm all smiles when I reach the radiology department
	the most cheery place in the whole bloodletting building
	"we missed you" says the woman behind the desk
	she has some ethnicity. somewhere warm. Hawaii, perhaps
	then Mary Kay signs me in, matronly with a hint of cartoonish joy
	but all serious business when she gets a phone call
	trying to locate a missing patient
	"who takes an ambulance to surgery?" she asks, exasperated.
	I take a seat and wait, reading. Animal Planet on the television
	seems too bright and exposed a setting for such a seedy book
	but all else fades as I dig into it
	jerking my head when a woman with a clipboard says "Dennis"
	"Are you a Dennis, too?" he asks me. I deny and dive back down
	finally it's my turn
	black-haired stranger has come to fetch me
	we navigate the maze to room 4
	the overwhelming whiteness makes the room surreal
	I lie on the CT bed, disembodied. "It's moving sluggish today" she says
	she compliments the skulls on the shoes poking out from under the blanket
	(they cover the corpus when you wear a zipper since you need to lower pants)
	asks me familiar questions. and sometimes a surprising one
	"what are we looking for today? some kind of lump?"
	finds a juicy vein and I warn her they can be deceptive
	"you're not going to look, are you?" as she readies the needle.
	but I like to look. "as long as you don't flinch" she says
	she works the needle a while, it's just a little splashy
	and when I turn my head away it succeeds. push in saline.
	the delicious taste of plastic and then comes the vein warmer
	I hold my breath when the robot tells me to
	and a little while later the ride's over.

<h1>1.4cm</h1>
<pre>
10/22/08
	1.4cm
	another CT, a follow-up, a nuisance, nothing more
	the test is Wednesday morning, I forgot my papers
	left them on the table in the kitchen
	it's been four months since I've had anything to do with doctors
	but I remembered to drink my contrast
	and everything goes smoothly
	the next Wednesday is the office visit
	she spooks me as I'm reading Orwell
	Shooting an elephant - gouts of blood
	she takes my vitals.
	"You have the pulse of an athlete - do you work out?"
	and asks about the pieces of computer (RAM) on my back pack
	affable and kind, she makes me smile
	No, I haven't been in pain
	just the usual
	1.4cm
	waiting in the room. door closed. reading, reading.
	the roomness of it is oppressive, the walls feel so near
	I hear one of the staff describing a shelf that holds plates
	and she sounds - not rude, but rigid - serious and severe, urgent
	domestic matters, trifles - but no sense of frivolity, no humor
	and the doctor comes in and asks how I'm doing
	off with my shirt and he tells me
	my scan has a thing that wasn't there before
	and that sentence sours the day's flavor
	get a PET scan as soon as possible
	it isn't big, just 1.4cm
	something about cutting it out with a something-scope
	(putting me to sleep first, but not the endless sleep)
	I'm just sorta stunned and simply put, I'm pissed
	that this might mess up my plans
	and I so seldom make them
	but let's not get ahead of ourselves, he says
	let's get the PET scan and see if there is any activity
	and to avoid bifurcating my Thursday with a 1pm appointment
	I schedule mine for Monday morning.
	No big deal, I figure
	but I'm tired.  I've been tired for days
	and if the sickly feeling don't go away until they knife me
	well, then it will be hard to enjoy this weekend
	the grapefruit that made me cough never made me sick
	if this weary feeling is caused by 1.4cm maybe its more aggressive
	time bomb in my guts and sitting with sleepy eyes
	and I just want to sleep the forever sleep
	it's all I can think about for a while
	and then I concentrate on not thinking about it
	playing ping pong and I smile and I want to awaken
	and do I say anything to co-workers, friends, or family?
	I'll let them know if I need time for the bye-bye blade
	but I can keep it quiet until then
	no point in making a fuss
	not for 1.4cm
	
	little death inside of me
	and I feel like we are friends
	though I can't look him in the eye
	
10/24/08
	and now it's Friday; the third day
	of knowing without knowing
	I haven't spoke of it yet
	smiling and cheerful
	but when nobody is looking
	fret and fidget furtively
	I cough and panic
	change the song
	and dive back into work
	nothing can be done about it
	just detach myself from myself
	and pity the person to whom this happens
	It's 10am, I've only been here three hours but
	this day has already gone on too long, too long
	but then a colleague calls me away from my desk
	some technical discussion with light banter
	and while laughing my joy is genuine
	
	One missed call, from this morning, from my father.
	I call him back and we talk about beds.
	To Grandma-proof the house I need some bed component
	And then I talk with Mother and she sounds depressed
	She doesn't say anything sad, but sounds depressed
	it's almost on the tip of my tongue
	but I don't want to talk about it
	so I don't say anything
	and I don't ask why she sounds forlorn
	
10/25/08  Saturday
	from my meditation
	in the soft vanilla water of the bathtub
	I rise with determination
	I must get out and see the world
	put on Skull Shirt, Skull Socks, Skull Shoes
	and leather jacket to attack the day
	I pause.  tired and disoriented
	afraid.  destination unknown
	
	I end up at the world bird sanctuary
	it's nice to see purveyors of death on such a day
	at a safe distance, through a cage
	I stare into the bird eyes and they look fake
	or is it just that the fake ones look so real
	and am I in the cage or is he
	ah, yes.  it is definitely he.
	I have a far greater range of motion
	therefore he is the one in the cage
	no point in sullying semantics
	not for a lone romantic
	
	and through the building that has snakes
	and the birds that talk
	she looks like Laura Reedy
	handling the kestrel
	and the children
	the kestrel is my favorite bird
	(I don't care much for children)
	
	I sit and read by the pond that burbles
	watching the little birds at the feeder
	and the coi swim
	a little girl climbing on the rocks
	has a pink skull and crossbones on her shirt
	cute.
	
	and then I head to Van Goghz for a gin martini
	An adventure!  I dare boldly declare
	but I get through the door
	and damn, it's just a bar
	filled with bar people
	Behind the counter a typical brawn
	and one more portly with a mohawk
	serving to typical bar people, beer drinkers
	the shapes become people
	the pretty blonde tells a story
	about finding a girl she knows broke down on a scooter
	her future self is named Gwendolyn
	a broken 'fly with sunken eyes
	"I don't mind drinking before 10am"
	she needs to check on her black kittens
	a church group is on the way, I hear.
	my heart sinks
	"Yeah, I guess they're catholic"
	but it's a gay-friendly church, I grin
	their leader has a crush on the bartender
	
	and here I am, still a foreigner, alone
	but the drink sinks in, becomes my skin, my sin
	I am seen, but still solo, reading quietly.  then writing
	and until Gwendolyn asks how is she doing
	I'd forgotten about cancer.
	Tom Petty plays - You don't know how it feels
	and I relax.  melting into the wooden chair, bar stool
	and I remember what my dad said (with a slight slur, I think)
	"I used to hang out in bars.  I had friends there" (paraphrased)
	With the implication that he gave it up for family
	in the tone like Moxy Fruvous singing:
	"Couldn't call it a loss or a win"
	I worry more about inheriting his curse
	than I do about a damnable little intangible like cancer
	
	can't drive like this, stranded.   it's only 18:00
	quick calculation based on drink size, my weight
	wait, how am I calculating?  I'm missing some numbers here
	
	Halloween decorations.  so this is where they end up.
	they talk and I shouldn't be here.
	I'm not meant for this world.
	afraid that I'll do another stupid thing
	my ink flows, but my cerebellum holds shit for words
	funny how that works.
	without this written record, I'd never believe I thought this.
	surrounded by booze and temptation, the thing I thirst for is water
	let me regain my bearings.  water, only.  I have some in the car
	but I sit still.  no more voices in the place.
	"Doin' all right, bro?"
	"Yeah" I answer automatically with medium gusto
	and I see my fat fuzzy digits move mechanically over the soft pages of my book
	reading lines of poetry that hit a target of me that understands less,
	but feels more.
	And I feel that I am without location
	Until I hear a song play that previously I had only heard by Weird Al
	And I notice myself, in leather and despondence.  out of place
	Alone.  Me and the bartender.  My tip and martini glass
	I am unaccustomed with the proper mannerisms of this sort of establishment
	but despite it all I feel good, damn good
	
	two couples walk in, ask for menus
	suddenly I'm the incumbent
	"this is a martini bar"
	he says in a fancy shirt and inside I scoff
	how did this happen? and "where is my mind" starts playing
	I love this song and I'm looking at the art on the wall
	Sheila A Lewis - stuff that looks like starry night
	I wonder what'll happen when the song ends
	the final, fading crow of the cock
	and it slides into emo.  Fall Out Boy, Arms Race.
	The bartender whistles along.  The sun sets.
	I drive myself home to drink scotch
	and to further forget myself
	
10/26/08  Sunday
	played Planescape Torment and watched videos on my computer
	didn't once leave the house.  I'm not sure I said anything.
	not feeling too sick, maybe it's a false alarm
	Typical Sunday
	
	First missed call and I'm intrigued
	It's a Brentwood number, close by
	but I don't know anyone named Seema Patel
	After the second missed call I decide to call back
	"I received a call from this number and I don't know who you are"
	"Is this Dave Bennett?  I didn't leave a message; you must have caller ID"
	OK, this is weird.  A woman calling me at 19:00 on a Sunday
	and she knows my name.
	Oh, it's the technician that is doing my PET scan tomorrow
	No, I'm not diabetic
	remember to hydrate, don't eat
	take medication with a cracker
	(but I'm not on medication)
	find your way to outpatient at 9:30
	then we'll take you to the van in the parking lot
	
10/27/08
	Monday morning
	stop into work
	send some emails
	explaining that I'll be late
	missing a meeting
	ready for a build
	work phone says 6:40am
	the rest of the world is at 7:35am
	I set up stuffed monkey Harold in my stead
	with a post-it on his chest, introducing himself
	I hope he doesn't check in any bugs; he's using my CVS login
	
	I step in and it's somber
	(I shouldn't be this surprised)
	I start to regret wearing another skull shirt (HackADay)
	but the lady at the registration desk laughs
	and says she likes it
	
	I arrived too early
	sitting, waiting
	
	then take the lift into the van/truck/thing
	and they ask me the usual sorts of questions
	starting with my birthday. who sent me here
	No, I'm not diabetic.  No, I didn't eat
	then a few unexpected questions
	like spell seminoma
	how tall I am and how much I weigh
	and how exactly did I get a testicle in my chest
	I gesture with my hands: well, this is how it was told to me...
	
	there's an old man behind the curtain
	makes hardly a sound
	it's sleepy time
	while glucose circulates
	I laugh to see the little lead cylinder around the syringe
	You'll be radioactive for about 6 hours, but you won't glow
	Seema grabs my foot gently in passing
	calls me chipper, then a real trooper
	the man goes to the scanning tube
	a woman cycles into his chair
	"Hello, young... person.  How old are you?  I'm 65"
	"Is this your first PET scan?  Ah, you're an old pro"
	45 minutes of sitting in a chair
	absorbing radioactive sugar
	afraid to move too much
	20 minutes in the tube
	close your eyes
	
	when I arrive Harold has a note from wxw on his head
	he is too cute to punch, but he is not working at all
	very bad.  so the punches are saved for Dave.
	I'm pummeled the first time she sees me
	then later she asks about the bracelet
	and I try to dodge the question
	"Are you alright?"
	"Probably"
	"You better be"
	
	anxiously awaiting a phone call
	feeling great, then feeling bad
	then back to great again
	ignorance is the twist
	17 becomes 18:00
	I'm exhausted
	
10/28/08  Tuesday
	at 15:00 my phone vibrates.  heart races
	text message from someone I don't know
	New York number  "How's the show?!  Esau"
	I wish I knew whether or not I have cancer again.
	
	Parents call, asking for their rock band dongle
	and Mom sounds chipper, she cancels Christmas
	not for everbody, mind you.  just for us
	let's take a trip instead
	
10/29/08  Wednesday
	I don't feel well today
	
	I take a half an hour to mail the package
	and I'm told that the world fell apart in my absence
	"Don't get hit by a bus"
	(Did she just say that her name is Gin, More Shoe?)
	
	Trying to get an answer
	I call the number that showed up when Tracy called
	to remind me of my last appointment
	but a robot answers the phone
	and no choice sounds comforting
	I hang up
	
10/30/08  Thursday
	the person before me got four dollars worth of gas
	and across the street at the Jiffy Lube
	the guy with the sign is quite animated
	hawking an oil change for 19.99
	livid and screaming
	gesturing wildly
	
10/31/08  Friday
	driving to Galebsurg
	into the rising sun
	birds beyond the bridge
	across the Mississippi
	
	back at Knox
	register, sign the wall
	beautiful weather, sitting outside
	waiting for class to begin
	
	it's now warm enough for me to take my shoes off
	and read my book on a bench in front of Old Main
	a woman with a British accent and a guy in a Fedora
	ask me where is seminary street
	"I'm looking for a strong cup of coffee
	and Seminary street is where I can get one, right?"
	it all seems to me quite lovely
	
	During the CS get-together my pocket vibrates
	Voice on the phone says Lumb nodule, Barnes West County
	biopsy to be sure it's not a recurrence
	Pluard calls and says activity, thoracic surgeon, pluck-it-out
	
11/03/08  Monday
	Morning call from the office of Bryan Meyers, Thoracic surgeon
	"How does your tomorrow afternoon look?"
	I'm pretty damn excited to talk to a thorax expert
	The leaves are in full glory as I look out the window
	at red peeking through a mane of yellow
	afire when the sun hits it
	
	I stare at the potato soup
	sitting in my plastic spoon
	I put pepper in it without even tasting it
	colors suspended in bland white
	strange, uneven textures
	the coagulation of cream
	and my friends are in Wisconsin
	or Chicago or Ohio or Scotland
	and I am alone in St. Louis
	with my potato soup
	
	Getting quietly agitated, knowing not to say anything
	I am unprovoked and I'd look like a jerk
	but I'm tired and I want to snap
	finding it hard to concentrate on anything
	I knock out a dialog because it's easy and I don't have to think
	but most of the mindless tasks are too low a priority to justify doing them
	so I stare into space and call it "thinking about Genomic Integration"
	and then I'm interrupted by one person or another
	pretending that the intrusion irritates me
	when actually it saves me
	
	I call my mother when I get home
	and give her the news
	she offers to come down
	but we're old pros at this, I tell her
	and we'll wait and see
	
11/04/08  Tuesday, Election Day
	My appointment moved to 1400
	Doctor is in emergency surgery
	So I meet with the Nurse Practitioner
	Mom calls while I'm waiting
	says she's on the way
	her coworkers made her go
	and they give me a picture of my lung
	talking about surgery options
	and it starts to feel real
	
	lean back and relax, she says with her hand on my shoulder
	you are so tense I believe that you would snap
	if I tried to move you
	
	I show the picture to my coworkers
	"What's that a picture of?"
	"My tumor"
	
11/05/08  Wednesday
	Wake and watch the news with my mother
	Apparently, Obama won.
	
	What are the possible ways to get this out?
	Well, there's a needle they can stick in you
	like your first biopsy - if it's small enough they can get it all out
	and then theres a method where they stick in a video camera
	one where there's a larger incision and the doctor sticks in his finger
	Another possibility is through the inside, something bronchial
	but I don't think we'll go that route
	Ah, screw it - I'm doing it myself
	hand me the swizzle stick
	
	Ma calls, asking for more information
	I haven't heard anything
	I call the thorax office
	looking for an update, an estimate
	Dr. is in surgery, I'm transferred to Denise
	they looked at my films, probably a CT/Biopsy
	Good news, I think - one of the least intrusive options
	Some knock-out juice and needle time and then it is over
	They only do them on Tuesdays and Thursdays ; probably next week
	Not good news for Mother who has obligations back home
	and now I regret having told her too early
	she is stressed and I am agitated
	I eat a fudge brownie and calm down
	I told her not to come, but I'm glad to see her
	she needs to take responsibility for her decision
	
	Denise calls 16:00, tells me the Biopsy/CT is next Thursday 11/13
	10:00 at Big Barnes, Downtown.
	I head home earlyish
	A woman sitting in a white car waves me down
	looking for a jump.  I go upstairs and get Ding
	I find pasta shells waiting for dinner
	And Mother is feeling better now
	Play some Wii fit, I call Ryan
	who is at the Parent's house fixing his jeep
	we discuss Fallout 3 - he agrees with the Sweedes
	it is Obilivion with Guns
	While I'm talking to him Mom calls Dad
	Dad asks Mom to ask Me to ask Ryan if the pizza is done
	and then we have speakerphones and echos in stereo
	
	It's not a bag, not a truck - it's tubes and sponges
	We're checking YouTube to see inside a lung
	My insides are dark and foreign to me
	Here's a pig and here's a sheep
	
11/06/08  Thursday
	Cleaning the kitchen
	on such a beautiful morning
	It's still near 70 and rain starts to fall
	Mom heads home.  Report cards call
	
11/07/08  Friday
	On the socks, skulls and space invaders
	I see one in my coffee cup now
	in the espresso foam
	
	This is like I expect war to be
	characterized by stretches of nothing
	losing men to attrition, disease, desertion
	and only occasionally is there action
	a flare-up from a chance encounter
	grit your teeth and endure it
	come alive
	then the battle ends
	bury your dead and carry on
	losing men to attrition, disease, desertion
	
11/10/08
	They gave me a blue book "Instructions for Chest Surgery Patients"
	I found most of it rather comical; I don't think it is meant for me:
	Alert us if you are taking Abciximab, Aggrastat, Aspirin, Lovenox,
	Vitamin E, Warfarin
	  'That sounds more like a game than a medication'
	There are TWO LUNGS in the chest.
	  The job of the lungs is to breathe in oxygen for the body to use
	Eating is out!
	Rest and relax the night before surgery.  Ask for a sleeping pill if needed.
	Give all your belongings to your family for safe keeping
	Remove all of the following:  dentures, nail polish, all underwear,
	artificial body parts
	Bring comfortable shoes with non-slip soles to walk in after surgery
	Go to the bathroom before you receive your medicine
	We will place a mark on your body on the side of the surgery.
		   We will ask you to confirm which side will be operated upon.
	Your doctor wants you to use an Incentive Spirometer to help you breathe deeply
		   Concentrate on feeling your chest sink down and in.
	You will have special IV's put in your neck and wrist.
		   They will remain in place for several days after surgery.
	You might wake up with a breathing tube in your mouth.
		   Do not try to talk while the tube is in your mouth.
	You will have nothing to eat or drink after surgery.
		   You will start with liquids when your doctor says you are ready.
	You may not have much of an appetite.
	The patient will be looking more like himself/herself, but will tire easily.
		   You will be taught about going home.
	You need a balance of rest and exercise for recovery.
		   Do not stay in bed.  Get dressed every day.
	Do not lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk until your doctor says you can.
	You can resume sexual relations when you feel comfortable.
		   For many people this is about 2 to 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital.
	Do not use powder for at least one month.
	You may have mood swings and feel depressed.
		   Do not become discouraged.
	
11/11/08  Tuesday
	Denise calls and asks me to arrive at 09:00
	and they need lab work, asks me the last time I had my CBC
	Has it been more than 30 days?  I speculate.  Probably not.
	And they also want PTT.  Where do you want to get that done?
	(Like I know what I'm doing)  You've had them done all over...
	And so we're chatting of labs.  Quest Dx, Barnes Jewish, and Christian NE
	She calls back almost immediately.  Telling me that I'm young
	And not on blood thinners.  So they don't need the PTT
	Lab is just a minor inconvenience, but I feel a deep sense of relief
	Then DJ stops by and tells me that a High School kid is coming in
	and that I will be talking to him in about 30 minutes about testing the software
	Justin asks me which Jing is on the left and which is on the right.
	Tomorrow is an interview with Lina Dong
	Ding and Dong Playing Ping and Pong
	I anagram her into An Old Gin
	(he says it can also be spelled Dung, but is pronounced like Doong)
	
	I stop by the grocery store on the way home
	to get stuff to make chicken curry
	cashier asks me, in a British accent, if I am a musician
	a certain Je ne se quoi with a flourish of the hand
	"It was a compliment, my son plays the cello"
	
11/12/08  Wednesday
	I'm not sure how she got it
	she really shouldn't have my extension
	and I hint that she should call the main number
	since I will be out of town for a few days
	and she wishes me a happy vacation
	
	getting antsy and agitated
	trying not to show that I'm three weeks weary
	I think I felt it kick
	
	Ambulance, six cop cars, police dog
	at the neighbors house as Mother and Aunt Kim arrive
	and we've still no idea what the commotion was about
	the woman pulled out on a stretcher
	minutes later, the man drives away
	The timer goes off and my chicken curry is ready
	
11/13/08  Thursday
	Morning
	driving east on I-44
	we see a billboard for the cyberknife
	I wish I had one of those
	
	it's just a biopsy
	arrive at Big Barnes
	past the fountain, navigate the maze
	everybody asks me my full name and birthday
	go up to radiology and the desk hands me a phone
	"tell them that you want to register for a CT"
	the doctor introduces himself, Dr. Maldonado
	after a few tries the desk lady decides that she can't pronounce it
	"I'll just ask for Ronaldo"
	then they stick in the IV "just in case"
	and I hate having it in my arm, the tape is the worst
	"Do you know why you're here?" the doctor asks
	"1.4cm" I tell him.  I've done this before, I explain 
	there's a chance, small chance that they'll pierce the lung
	and I'll have to stay overnight to re-inflate it
	didn't they call you last night, didn't you bring a change of clothes?
	meh.  if it happens I'll just wear these clothes tomorrow
	the operation just takes a few minutes
	It's mostly getting into position and observation afterwards
	
	up to the fifth floor for the procedure
	I'm awake through the whole thing
	lying on the CT bed
	face down and I hate lying like that
	various doctors introduce themselves as they walk in
	my right arm falls asleep
	robots and doctors talking to me
	take a breath and hold it
	you can breathe
	then drawing on me with the sharpie marker
	you'll feel a scratch then some stinging
	stinging of the local anesthesia
	a wet back
	you'll feel some pressure
	then some pain
	don't be surprised
	take a breath and hold it
	keep holding, keep holding
	don't breathe, don't breathe
	you can breathe gently now
	sounds like there's an amature poking me
	and some older doctors giving him advice
	then someone else takes a stab or two
	scanned intermittently, in and out the tube
	you'll feel a scratch then some stinging
	you'll feel some pressure
	take a breath and hold it
	keep holding, keep holding
	don't breathe, don't breathe
	breathe gently now, gently, gently
	right arm falls off the bed and I have to pick it up with the left
	you did well, he says.  sounds optimistic
	you'll have some blood and ink on your back, but you bathe daily, right?
	he puts on two bandaids
	"it's a small lesion, but I think that we got it"
	"it's a combination of art and luck"
	
	I roll over into a stretcher and I'm carted away
	lying on my back watching the ceiling go by
	I have a glowing finger from the oxygen detector
	and I'm trying to get the high score
	It seems that if I relax I can get it down to 95
	but I don't think I can get it up past 100
	it beeps, regularly.  then a double beat
	then faster.  slower.  skips a beat
	they take an x-ray and I'm free to move about the floor
	Mom and Kim bring me a ham sandwich
	we analyze the vending machine
	waiting for the next x-ray
	
	the x-rays afterwards look good
	no punctured lung, no overnight stay
	We'll get results in two to four business days
	
11/14/08
	We drive to Union Station
	looking for the Megabus stop
	then to the zoo to see the baby tigers
	3 boys, 2 girls - playful and cute
	trying to eat the small birds
	
11/16/08  Sunday
	Getting the last of the solidified creamer out of the container
	so that she can use it for the remnants of brown sugar
	stabbing at it with a butter knife
	chunk, chunk, slice
	finger blood all over
	moments of panic
	nearest hospital?
	we subdue it
	and just head to Walgreens for better bandaging
	she apologizes and apologizes while I tell her not to
	and then I call her a knucklehead
	because it is what she would say to me
	we go for a walk at Queeny park, dogs and horses
	then while vacuuming the spare bedroom it re-opens
	spurting blood, centimeters in the air in time with her pulse
	and so I take her to the Urgent Care center
	where they put on liquid bandage
	and tell her to stop vacuuming
	
11/17/08  Monday
	back at work, 58 emails waiting
	doesn't look like anything is on fire
	I find out that I have an interview this morning
	Games and graphics - my interest is inflated
	deflated when I learn it's all web-stuff
	
11/18/08
	And now it's noon on Tuesday
	I am waiting for the result of my biopsy
	waiting, waiting
	waiting
	
11/19/08
	Wednesday
	waiting
	
	In software you inherit the sins of your fathers
	Fixing bugs forged when I was still in school
	Turn the music up until it hurts a little
	and let it blast away all else
	
	Click Click Boom, The Dirty Glass
	leg moves.  nervous tick or a phone call?
	waiting, waiting
	
	I call the doctor
	Denise answers
	heart flutters, butterflies
	it's not in my patient chart
	she checks the hospital chart
	still no results - what's the holdup?
	she calls the pathologist then calls me back
	the cells are atypical, but we can't confirm the type
	whether malignant or benign, seminoma or something else
	if the results remain inconclusive then they will do a lung biopsy
	
	it's not hope that I cling to, but rather ignorance
	my eyes are dancing around the room
	but nowhere do I see an escape
	not from the enemy inside
	I just want to scream
	that this is petty and I don't have time for this bullshit
	instead I'm just a little snarky and do my best to ignore myself
	and each false smile leaves me a little more flayed
	until it feels like my skin will no longer hold
	
	waiting
	
11/20/08  Thursday
	One thing after another
	Plumbing problems due to roots
	My ingrown toenail is painfully infected
	Passport renewal rejected, bureaucratic bullshit
	Mother locks herself out of her running car trying to deal with this
	She was planning to go home on Wednesday
	Father arrives.  Without a plan, I think.
	Parents start to doze while we watch Pushing Daisies
	
11/21/08  Friday
	I hear stirring, I suppose, that wakes me at one am; sobbing and panic
	something about money, I think.  The walls are thin but I try not to listen
	it takes a glass of water and some soothing music to get me back to sleep
	
	I'm on the phone with a customer for an hour and fifteen minutes
	my punishment for showing up at work early
	he's a nice guy, but a little slow
	Thorax calls my cell while I'm on the phone
	I miss the call
	Make an excuse to transfer the call to a coworker who has since arrived
	The results of the needle biopsy are still inconclusive
	they want to do a lung biopsy
	In the bathroom I take a private moment to break down
	dry sobs
	I just can't take it anymore
	Unable to smile, even a fake smile
	trying to keep my face stony and unreadable
	while inside I have fallen apart
	
	appointment at 13:00
	parents stop by the office, I show them the taco picture
	I finally meet Bryan Meyers, who is less intimidating than I expected
	he speaks frankly and he smiles.  he downplays his role in this
	"humble and surgeons don't usually go together..." he jokes
	there is a possibility that it is granuloma rather than cancer
	(living in the Midwest, spending time outside.  do you camp?)
	Mother asks questions.  I just stand and listen.
	Two options:  cut it out or wait and see
	I have to make the choice
	And both options suck
	
	he describes the procedure, including the part where he sticks the
	video camera then maybe his finger in my lung
	I nearly burst out laughing; ma says she wanted to shout out "swizzle stick!"
	"I would have done it if you had looked at me"
	then a stapler to keep the lung closed
	a button I can push for morphine
	you'll probably go home the next day
	
	or leave it in, get scans every 3 months and watch its size
	if you don't mind having it hang over your head the whole time
	
	I'm given a printout of the pathologist's report:
	"Aspirate smears show rare groups of epithelial cells with moderate
	sized, ovoid nuclei.  the aspirate smear lacks the 'tigroid
	background' often seen in seminoma.  There are scattered multinucleate
	cells.  The presence of giant cells is somewhat confusing; there are
	both foreign body type giant cells with fewer numbers of nuclei, and
	some what more syncytial appearing larger cells with as many as fifty
	nuclei.  Seminoma can induce granulomatous reaction; distinction
	between tumor induced giant cells and infectious giant cells is not
	possible on this limited sample."
	
	and it describes me as "a 27 year old man, status post orchiectomy for
	seminoma, now with new 9mm left lower lobe nodule"
	orchiectomy, huh?  It means they chopped my balls off.  As far as I
	know that hasn't happened yet.  Not physically, at least
	
	A weight is shifted; nothing will happen in the short term
	I can't yet concentrate, but my stress starts to melt
	devel meeting at 14:30 and now I'm doing fine
	
	at 16:00 Pluard calls - let's get a CT on Tuesday and check the size of it
	if it is smaller, it's probably just an infection and nothing to worry about
	if it isn't...
	we aren't going to worry about that until after Thanksgiving
	
11/22/08  Saturday
	parents go home
	the house is quiet again
	
11/24/08  Monday
	In the sixth or seventh hour of the day the sickness starts to kick in
	the kind that comes when the stress has passed
	and the body no longer is in combat mode
	
	Little brother arrives with a toolbox full of toys
	soldering gun, capacitors and a bread board
	I compliment the flames on his Jeep
	
11/25/08  Tuesday
	Morning CT
	I'm reading Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences
	a woman comes in with a walker
	I overhear her birthday
	born in 1921
	
	I'm thinking of getting future scans at West County
	it's closer to my home and work
	but I like Mike the CT Guy in St. Peters
	he reminds me of a dentist that isn't an asshole
	
	Pluard calls 16:38
	he's looked at the CT scan
	the spot is still there - let's pluck it out he says
	it's not urgent - it can wait until after Thanksgiving
	
11/27/08  Thanksgiving
	"Remember when I had a turkey on my head?"
	after banging her head on the freezer door
	food preparation, eating, cleaning
	wii bowling with grandma
	something about tricks and dogs
	requests songs while we play rock band
	she likes the Police - Roxanne until she hears it
	and Jon Bon Jovi because he's been married to the same girl for so long
	I'm writing in Scheme for the programming contest we have going at work
	
12/01/08  Monday
	a presentation from an interviewee
	on an approach to targeting Ovarian cancer
	the ovary is different from the eye
	but not as different as you might think
	they are both immune-privileged organs
	things the body is hesitant to inflame
	it is unpleasant to go through chemotherapy, she says
	decreased quality of life
	and destroyed pancreas and diabetes
	Are you all familiar with a PET scan?
	"Give us some good news!"
	Looking at placentas and PCR
	she got lucky in some bench work
	ICOS is regulated by a single ligand
	specificity is a good thing
	
12/05/08
	Friday, 16:00 Father calls
	on behalf of Mother, it seems
	they are getting anxious for results, for it to be over
	and so I call the thorax office, but Denise has left for the day
	she might call me back this weekend, or maybe not 'til Monday
	it doesn't bother me.  I'm not bothered at all
	Mike and his Family are visiting the Parents for Christmas
	and Dad is trying to plan a happy, stress-free Holiday
	I'm not sure that I'll make it this year
	my sinuses are sore and I think my right lymph node is swollen
	the brain in my head is swimming in a resigned daze
	ready to fade into sleep
	
12/07/08
	15:30 on Monday and I realize that I haven't heard back from Denise yet
	ah well, c'est la vie and c'est la mort  all things come in proper time
	I count the lines in my coffee cup - from leaving it sit on the table
	I touch my face and try to count the lines there
	it is moisturized and relatively smooth
	scar over my left eyebrow
	and spots of stubble left from this morning's hack job with a razor
	I've reached the age where there is no selection bias against the
	expression of genes that kill me
	
	17:00 Denise calls.
	She received my message
	I had prepared my explanation
	but the conversation starts in the middle
	You must be calling because you want an operation
	the thorax people discussed my CT and were all like "Did you order that?"
	"No, man.  I didn't order that - it must have been Pluard"
	Did you talk to your oncologist?
	But what does it all mean?
	So, you'll be wanting this before Christmas?
	Yeah, I guess - if you can do it before then
	Kim the scheduler will call you later
	or maybe I will, says Denise
	
12/11/08  Thursday
	Morning I head downtown for pre-testing
	the lobby, the hospital is beautiful, bright and open
	pleated glass climbs seven stories
	
	Do you have or have you had?
	presently to heart murmur, never to just about everything else
	the last is cancer - I don't know whether to mark past or presently
	and to the question When was your last menstrual period?
	flip over the form to confirm that I marked male
	I assume that it makes the question optional
	
	Sitting at the registration desk
	and they ask me so many questions this time
	who to contact in case of emergency
	"Does your mother have a middle name?"
	my mind goes blank J-J-Jean, I stammer
	it sounds strange to say it, rolling the word in my head
	the woman expresses surprise and concern with regards to Paula Abdul's stalker suicide
	Where is Lake Villa?  And I describe Gurnee and Chicago, Wisconsin
	measure my neck, she said for sleep apnea "I'm not trying to choke you"
	they give me special soap to use, from neck down, not for face or genitals
	they laugh and sass in the hallway
	"You're worse than I am and I like aggravatin' "
	The anesthesiologist comes in next, the liveliest of the group
	(and I expected her to be the most sedate)
	compact and vibrant - she treats me like a person
	when most just treat me like a product
	has me looking up, down, left, right
	then just the eyes, then breathing, etc
	looking at the ECG result from years ago
	"Normal, normal, normal - it couldn't get any better than this!"
	she enters the information into an old reflection client to a session
	what looks like an old-school unix command line app that predates curses
	A quick stick for lab work - magic touch - no digging, but it leaves a bruise
	things that are verboten for a week - aspirin and vitamin E
	means no more Boost for breakfast - I don't know what I'll have instead
	mandarin oranges in jello, I guess - I'm back down to 116lbs
	
12/12/08  Friday
	there are things that you do
	and things that you endure
	the distinction has become fuzzy of late
	eating Gouda cheese while watching Death and the maiden
	I think that it tastes good, but mostly I can't taste
	life comes at me, goes around me
	I just stay out of its way
	the grave will take me just the same
	it doesn't mind that I only pretended to be here
	
12/18/08  Thursday
	Up at 5ish
	to arrive at the hospital around six
	Dad tries an alternative route
	and finds barricade after barricade
	apparently the I64 construction has moved
	so far he's blown one stop sign and one red light
	we tell him to be careful when we spot the squad car
	
	we register and get the pager that looks like a taser
	fill out some paperwork
	they draw some blood and we wait some more
	I read a few lines from Paradise Lost
	I give my mother an account on my Linux laptop
	and put her in the sudoers group so she can access the Internet
	
	they call me up to the pre-op and give me a gown, a lovely little floral thing
	Harold and Kumar are my anesthesiologists, a couple of comedians
	everybody asks me name, birthday, the last time I ate
	I have IVs in both arms, but it's the A-line that really sucks
	they write YES with marker on my left side
	they have scheduled three hours, but they expect it to take an hour and a half
	
	I lose consciousness
	and wake up in the recovery room
	groggy and with additional tubes sticking into me
	oxygen in my nose
	I hear them talking about my blood pressure
	too low, too low.  lost too much blood
	
	parents come by and I only vaguely remember pieces
	the first thing that my mother says to me is "you look terrible"
	"we have five minutes" (we're from the future)
	the good news is that you don't have cancer
	the bad news is that my lung had scar tissue sticking it to the ribs
	complicating the procedure - they had to scrape it off
	bleeders and gushers - the doctor has never seen so many
	had to make a large incision
	I was in there for three hours
	and they didn't have time to look at more lymph nodes
	I'm leaking air - the bubbles in the blue fluid
	and when I take breath I drain a reddish orange substance
	but everything is looking up
	
	I'm moved to the observation area for the night
	PCA is on my pole - a button I push for pain control
	an incentive spirometer to suck on - do it ten times an hour
	
	around midnight I seem to stop draining
	I hear more bubbles and I'm short of breath
	I can't get to my high score on the spirometer anymore
	a shot of benedryl into my vein tube and I'm feeling dreamy
	they give me an X-Ray and tell me that everything looks fine
	
12/19/08
	they give me two liquid meals in a row
	despite the doctor asking that I receive solids
	I don't mind.  the solid food here sucks anyway
	
	a physical therapist comes to make me walk - across the room and back
	do you want to wear your pain ball like a purse or a necklace?
	her primary concern seems to be with the visibility of my "tush"
	"I'll tie the back of the gown so that no one can see your tush"
	"I'm not looking at your tush" as she sets me back into my chair
	
	they move me to a room - my roommate is Jesus and he complains of diarrhea
	my parents bring me Jesus bandaids - and a pirate monkey of my own
	nurse hands me a urinal to piss in, but it's not easy
	they are threatening to put the catheter back in
	but I succeed with half an hour to spare
	
	I push the button - please take a look at my bandage, I 'm leaking
	Steve comes and explains that it's okay
	square peg and round hole
	it's not even from a tube hole, it's from the pain ball, local anesthesia
	and then he talks about food
	eat a little bit of everything, get outside food if you want it
	he had McDonalds after his surgery
	
12/20/08
	Saturday morning they move me to a new room
	one with a delightful view of Forest Park
	an elderly gay couple are checking out
	and when they do I am alone
	I'm feeling much better now
	I can detach the vacuum line and get up and walk
	watching the helicopter come and go
	In the afternoon my roommate is Mr. Smith
	he is a nice enough fellow and has a creepy clown balloon
	pirate monkey hangs from my pole
	with the water and the pain control
	my parents bring me pants
<img src = "images/fluid - halfway there.jpg" width=300 height=400>
	Barbara is a darling - a big, black mama - full of savvy and sass
	she gets them to consolidate my IVs
	and supervises as they take the front tube out
	
12/21/08  Sunday
	the back tube comes out, walking is easier now
	Mother is miffed that she didn't get a picture of its removal
	it's over there in the biohazard waste bin, if you want it
	I reached the third column, over 1050 somethings of fluid

<img src = "images/scar and bandages.JPG" width=300 height=400>	
	Julie the Jamaican nurse rolls me out
	she chides me for living alone
	and gives me a hug at the end of the ride
	
12/22/08  Monday
	I arrive at work around noon
	~1630 the 6.4 meeting ends; I drop a percocet
	OK, I'm not probably not going to code anything
	but this should make the 1800 meeting interesting
	
	Just before the meeting starts Jenny makes me go home
	You should be resting - Am I the only one that cares about you?
	
	Dad has been waiting on the couch
	he comments on how quiet the office is
	We eat at Applebees then shop at some stores
	Futile.  Fuckit.
	This year I give gift cards and just a little more
	
12/23/08
	On Tuesday Dad drives me north
	It's green until we hit Springfield
	where we see the first skirts of snow
	by Bloomington it's downright inhospitable
	we listen to PKD - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
	Dad works himself into serious anger at the other drivers
	swearing, speeding, swerving.  he drives well, but copes poorly
	
	lying in the dark my hands are moving
	in the borderland between reality and unreality
	I have the feeling that my hands aren't installed correctly
	maybe these aren't even the right hands
	but these are the only hands I have
	crossing and uncrossing my arms and what utility is it?
	why am I doing this?
	
12/24/08  Wednesday
	my first bowel movement since the operation
	I can stop nervously counting the days since my last
	
	a dream of my role in a junta, a regime change
	we are the opposite, he says
	pointing at a chart
	but the situation isn't so simple
	the negative of a picture changes everything while changing nothing
	
	I'm left home to nap while the rest go out for sledding
	I take pictures of snow and ice
	later, it starts to melt
	then it refreezes
	
12/28/08
	Ryan gives me a ride home
	Dorian Grey is lovely but Oscar Wilde fails to hold my interest
	Bears Discover Fire is surprisingly good - we get a few chuckles
	I play some EyeHateGod - screamcore and then we discuss it
	It's better when it's fast - you can dance to it - anger and catharsis
	the battery light goes on, but we make it home
	he isn't so lucky on the return trip
	Dad has to replace his alternator
	
	and time has moved - hurt and history - all in a haze
	sweating with the trench on, goose bumps with it off
	I'm waiting for reality to return, to find its strength
	
12/29/08  Monday
	today I make an early egress, 13:00
	I tell my coworkers that I may return after a nap
	at home I lay in bed and listen to another section of Slaughterhouse Five
	I'm really enjoying this audiobook
	I've adopted Ethan Hawke as the voice in my head
	
	and then I make the appointment for my follow-up
	the whole thing seems really neat
	the way the phone talks to me
	"I won't hang up until you are in the computer"
	and the directions for the x-ray
	enter the side door, it's the most popular door
	much more popular than the front door
	elevators and Gs, it's on the ground floor, you see
	"oh no!  am I confusing you?
	just come up and see us if you get lost"
	
	one of my wounds has become infected
	I am surprised to find my freezer de-iced
	and then I remember Dad telling me that he did it
	one day when I left him here alone
	or maybe he was with Mother
	and that the only thing he found in there was a nearly empty bottle of vodka
	which was really Gin, I tell him
	and today I pop another percocet and finish the gin
	I nurse my wound with hydrogen peroxide, neosporin and a bandaid
	
12/30/08  Tuesday
	I remember to take my garbage out
	Is it more than 10 pounds?
	I'm not supposed to lift more than 10 pounds, I think
	well, it's mostly dragging and the recyclables roll, anyway
	
	It's past 1700 and I'm still working
	I guess that means I'm getting better
	or just that I've found more interesting projects
	I play ping pong today.  still sore, about to bust a seam
	
12/31/08  Wednesday
	above my head there are four pieces of scotch tape
	holding in the black metal air blockers for the vents
	we're running an experiment
	the other vent has no tape and we're comparing the number of fatalities
	so far, there is no measurable difference between the two
	
	on New Year's Eve I'm asleep at 22:00
	so it goes
	
01/02/09  Friday
	today's follow-up starts with an x-ray
	and I have to wear a gown because my shirt has buttons
	I had four layers on.
	
	then I head upstairs
	I look over some papers on a clipboard, hand them back
	I'm down to 115.9 pounds
	oxygen at 95, then she changes the 5 to a 6
	
	Denise takes my blood pressure then takes a look at the incision
	I warn her that it got a little infected
	says it all looks good, good
	asks if I've been leaking
	then cuts off the stiches
	some people start oozing if they sneeze too hard
	I ask her if I should put neosporin on it
	she says no.  keep it dry
	don't use a bandaid, but you can use gauze
	
	she asks when I plan to return to work
	and I tell her that I've already been back
	she offers to provide me with excuses to skip work
	I laugh and thank her and decline her offer
	they let me take all the time I need
	and I'm feeling much better now
	
	sitting on the couch
	grinning all the while
	with a chemically induced smile
	
	weaning myself off the pills
	to save some for a rainy day
	but it seems to rain every day
	drinking beer, reading Bukowski
	
01/07/09  Wednesday
	I run my finger up and down my side
	here is the hole with swirls and snags
	and here is the ridge
	that starts low with a valley, a tender scar
	then the flat and flaky part that is the peeling glue
	then the top is puffy and painful, oozing
