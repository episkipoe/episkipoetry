You want a beer? No, I’m OK.
At five dollars a Bud, sure he’s OK.
The crowd is thin, both with and without total count normalization.
Looking a bit emo Missing on Monday plays a light set of alternative 90s covers.
Visible skin is broken skin, the wounded gazelle to the pack of lions.
Money makes the introduction, the rich white guy knows
But he’s a bore and quickly loses his bevy of birds.

Inside they inject a blast of cold fogged air
To cool a dance floor that is already room temperature
There is insufficient exothermic activity to warrant these measures.

Ode on a pole, treatise on a dancer.
She walks out with a serious, somber look on her face.
Bends over backwards on the stage, stretching.
In fuzzy leggings and fishnets.  
Looks like she forgot to put on pants.
With dollar signs not in her eyes, but rather on her prize.
In the ostentatious gold apparel which passed allure on its way to comical.
Your assignment:  500 words on the pole dancer.
Cover charge, nothing gentlemen:
That’s the price of admission.
He turns my head in her direction.
“You gotta stare at that ass - you paid five bucks for it”
“Are you writing down that the friggin’ stripper is so hot?”
The next person to lean into my ear says: “She’s not hot, man”
It’s just a bar, not a strip club; a casual distraction
She just sashays ‘round a maypole
With lackluster style
